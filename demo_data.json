      "title": "Climate change: The record summer that scorched Asia",
      "text": "Rain or shine, Mohammad Shukkur Ali, a rickshaw puller in his 50s, shows up for work on the streets of the Bangladesh capital Dhaka. The work is already punishing as it requires massive physical effort. But this year, the heat has made things even worse. Temperatures in the city hit 40.6C (105.8F) in April - a record high. But Mr Ali, who lives with his wife and two children in a rented room, says he has no choice but to endure the discomfort. \"I need to work because we are poor,\" he said. Mr Ali works eight-hour shifts every day in Gulshan, an affluent district in Dhaka which houses fancy apartments, sprawling corporate offices and several foreign embassies. To be even allowed into the area, he has to wear a jacket over his shirt - a uniform of sorts - which makes the heat even more uncomfortable. The gruelling heat in the country has been made worse by fuel shortages- a consequence of the Ukraine war - which has led to frequent power cuts. Millions of people across the world, including in North America and Europe, have experienced blistering heat this year. A large number of cities have reported record temperatures, with scientists saying that July is \"virtually certain\" to be the world's warmest month on record. Countries have pledged to keep the world from warming past 1.5C - a limit seen as a key threshold to prevent the worst of the impacts of climate change by reducing fossil fuel emissions. But scientists say there is a high chance that this limit will be breached in the next four years. The globe is now about 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times. But alarmingly, that increase has been even higher in Asia this year. A recent report, compiled by nearly two dozen climate scientists, found that temperatures earlier this year were up by 2C in many parts of Asia, a region home to more than 4.5 billion people. And the impact of this year's extreme heat has been felt in countries across the continent. At least 23 people have died from heat-related injuries in South Korea between May and August, more than triple the number from the same period last year. Temperatures had risen to as high as 38C in parts of the country. On Thursday, Hundreds of participants at the 25th World Scout Jamboree in Buan, were hit by heat exhaustion. Other parts of the country witnessed heavy rainfalls and floods. Japan issued heatstroke alerts across half of the country in mid-July after temperatures broke records in many parts of the country. The country's capital Tokyo alone saw temperatures reach a record-high of 38C (100.4F), 8C higher that an average Tokyo summer. And in just one week in July, local media reported that more than 9,000 people were hospitalised due to heatstroke across the country. China recorded its hottest temperature, when the mercury in a dusty western Xinjiang province town surged to 52C (125F) in July. Just a month earlier, the capital Beijing recorded its hottest June day in more than 60 years at 51C (123.8F). In India, an intense heatwave swept through the north of the country in May, with temperatures climbing to a record 49.2C (120.5F) in parts of the capital, Delhi. South East Asia also saw record temperatures in a number of countries in both April and May - which are typically the hottest months for the region. Heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in the world, sometimes killing more people than earthquakes, typhoons, or floods. They can also melt roads, destroy infrastructure, and start forest fires. Some experts call heatwaves a silent disaster because the deaths are often not immediately obvious - they can also trigger pre-existing conditions like diabetes, which are exacerbated in the heat and increase chances of dehydration. Extreme heat also forces the heart to work harder. Just a half degree rise in core body temperature can raise the heart rate by 10 beats per minute. Heatstroke can occur when the core body temperature rises and stays above 40C (104F), according to Mayo Clinic. It can lead to organ failure, cardiac arrest, and even death if left untreated. Heat increases moisture in the air and \"the sweat on your skin simply can't evaporate [and take the heat away] in the humidity,\" said Winston Chow, an associate professor of Urban Climate at Singapore Management University. \"It becomes dangerous when the body loses the natural ability to cool off.\" A 35C (95F) wet-bulb temperature - what scientists call the measure of heat plus humidity - is the \"absolute limit\" of human tolerance, according to Zach Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington. Senthil Logesh, a 26-year-old Indian construction worker in Singapore, said heat shelters and water points had to be installed on site where he currently works. Temperatures in parts of the city, which is humid throughout the year, had hit 37C (98.6F) in May, matching a record set four decades ago. The wet-bulb temperature was monitored on the site, and workers were asked to rest when it got too high. But even then, Mr Logesh, who works 10 hours almost every day of the week, said that everyone was always \"wet from sweating a lot.\" Over the next decades, population is expected to double in Asia, with the growth mainly in tier-two cities in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, according to Prof Chow, who also co-chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN's top climate science agency that assesses the socio-economic impact of climate change. \"Not only will there be more construction taking place, but it will also happen in hotter conditions, so we need to start looking at reducing risks for many vulnerable people,\" he said. While reducing emissions is important to prevent the world from warming further, Prof Chow said that countries also need to adapt to heatwaves, which will only increase in intensity and frequency. In South East Asia's wealthier countries like Singapore for instance, infrastructures exist to shield people from the heat, like air-conditioning in malls and homes. The country also plans to build more green spaces, covered walkways, and change building designs to offer more shelter. However, poorer countries in the same region are unable to implement similar measures. Even when plans to tackle heat exist, they are typically underfunded and often overlook poorer communities. Thailand, for example, has a national-level early warning system for heatwaves, asking people to find shelter or wear light-coloured clothing, according to Chaya Vaddhanaphuti, a co-author of the Asia heatwave report. \"But not everyone can do that, such as homeless people, the disabled, or the elderly. The plans need to be tailored to these groups as well,\" she told the BBC. \"This is all assuming people actually do as they are told. These plans serve more as general recommendations than specific instructions.\" One example of a low budget plan that has seen some success is one developed by the western Indian city of Ahmedabad in 2013, after experiencing a devastating heatwave that killed 1,344 people. Authorities used white paint on the tin and asbestos roofs of the homes of migrant slums to cool them. They make up a quarter of the city's households. Public parks are also kept unlocked throughout the day for street stall owners and construction workers to find shade. Other Indian cities have since tried replicating this plan. But critics say more can be done for the poorest communities who still suffer the brunt of natural disasters like heatwaves as they often don't have the means, or access to infrastructure, to cope. On hot summer nights in Nepal, 30-year-old Krishni Tharu falls asleep in the same room with her two children and mother-in-law, the whole family sharing a single standing fan. In the western city of Nepalgunj, where she works as a construction labourer, temperatures hit 44C (111F) in June. Nepal, home to Mount Everest, gets warm during the main summer period from May to July. Government data also shows that the temperature has been steadily on the rise every year. She's usually exhausted after working 10-hour days, from dawn to dusk, earning about US$4.50 each shift to support her family. Such gruelling, outdoor labour has only gotten harder in recent years as the heat has gotten worse, she said. But she can't stop. Cutting off her family's precious income is not an option, she told the BBC. \"There is no escape. I have to work.\" With reporting by Orchi Othondrila in Bangladesh and Bimala Chaudhary in Nepal.",

      "title": "Families in Turkey's quake cities battle dust and rubble six months on",
      "text": "Hulya Yesiloglu gazes just beyond her temporary tent city towards a cemetery and says she often wonders if she would have been better off ending up there rather than surviving Turkey's twin earthquakes. She stands at the mouth of a wood-burning oven baking flatbread on a sweltering summer day in the southern city of Antakya. Her old stone oven, where she has turned dough to bread for as long as she can remember, is the only part of her home that survived the earthquakes. The ancient city in Hatay province, 20km (12 miles) from the Syrian border, is still in a dangerous state of disrepair six months after it was ravaged by the February quakes. Even now thousands of people are living here in makeshift tents and container camps. Like ghosts, buildings stripped of their facades still lean over now-vacant lots where houses and businesses once stood. Dust covers every surface as the soundtrack of steel claws digging into piles of crumbled concrete and tangled metal plays unendingly in the background of everyday life. The Turkish government now estimates the cost to rebuild in the 11 provinces affected by the earthquakes will total $105bn (£82bn). But in Antakya, reconstruction isn't even a thought yet, since it's still in the throes of clearing away the rubble. Time has moved on, but progress with rebuilding has been slow, and people who remain, like Hulya, say they feel forgotten. \"Thank God nothing happened to my children, my husband, my loved ones, or my family, but being forgotten, not cared for, and being abandoned are very difficult things,\" she says. A few metres from where Hulya is baking her bread, her family's five-storey apartment building is still standing - but only barely. It was heavily damaged and is due for demolition. She and her husband, Metin, still live in the neighbourhood, but it is now reduced to rubble and buildings that have been shaken open by the earthquake, revealing endless rows of empty rooms inside. The couple's plastic tents are pitched just outside their old front door, but it's too hot to do anything but sleep in them at night and no-one is able to move beyond the disaster. \"Bodies are still being found. It's not over,\" says Hulya. \"If things continue like this, it will only get better after 20 years.\" Her assessment of the time needed to reconstruct this city is a far cry from the one-year deadline set for the region by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan days after the disaster. That's largely because the destruction across Hatay province was immense. More than 50,000 people died in Turkey in the 6 February disaster. In Hatay alone, some 23,000 people died and more than 30,000 were injured, according to Turkey's disaster management agency, Afad. The following month, the Turkish government assessed that no-one should remain in short-term shelters for more than six months. By July, 164,000 people were still living in tents and containers, according to Afad, in an assessment by the UN. \"We have solved some issues, however, there are still challenges,\" says Huseyin Yayman, a member of President Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP), and a representative of Hatay in parliament. \"Water is not available in the city and we are working to fix that,\" he adds. Mr Yayman believes that the rehabilitation process will take much longer than initially anticipated, too, and that financial help is vital - both national and international. \"It takes time to return to normal. I say two plus two: in two years, we can meet the basic needs of people. In two more years, we can start getting back to the new normal,\" he says. \"We want people from other regions of the country and around the world to help us in these areas because we need serious help. We have problems and we would be happy for them to assist.\" Mr Yayman admits that the distribution of aid has been somewhat uneven. In some tent cities further north in the province, the biggest concern is access to air conditioning, which helps to make the summer heat and humidity more bearable. But in the city centre where Hulya Yesiloglu's family lives, the priority is on safe drinking water. Hulya says she and her husband have run out of purified drinking water and are now relying on well water to cook and consume. \"Turkey has faced a huge test in this regard,\" Mr Yayman says. Permanent housing is at the top of the list for many in the region. About 80km (50 miles) north of the centre of Antakya, in the mountainous city of Hassa, new apartment blocks are rising up. The Turkish government has allocated about $370m (£290m) to the project, which is being built by an organisation within the environment ministry called Toki. Unlike so many of the buildings in Hatay province, Toki insists none of its structures collapsed in February's quake. This development will have 4,000 flats for 30,000 people and feature a school, health centre and a playground. Nurtac Yılmaz, whose construction company Yılkanur Insaat is building part of it, says the development won't be fully finished until next summer. \"Just because these constructions are done quickly doesn't mean they are unsafe or not earthquake-resistant,\" he says. When it is ready, this complex will be welcome news for the people of Hassa. Priority, Mr Yilmaz says, is being given to those whose homes were classified as heavily damaged. For others, like the Yesiloglu family, whose homes have been assessed as slightly damaged, it will be a longer road back to normality. \"If the government helps, we don't necessarily have to make [the new house] perfect. You can start slowly, just lay the foundation,\" says Metin Yesiloglu. \"Then, we can slowly finish it. We won't be in such distress. But now, they say they will conduct an analysis. They will tear down this building and analyse the soil here. If it's suitable, they'll allow construction. If it's not, then no, it won't happen.\"",

      "title": "The remarkable recovery of Syria's earthquake baby",
      "text": "When Afraa was found in the rubble of a collapsed building in Syria, her umbilical cord was still attached to her mother, who had died just after giving birth. The video of the baby's rescue from the earthquake in February captivated the world. Since then she has made a remarkable recovery. Today, Afraa is six months old - a typical happy, healthy baby. Her aunt and uncle are raising her along with their seven children in the Syrian town of Jindayris, not far from the Turkish border. \"She's very still young but she reminds me of her dad and her sister Nawara, especially her smile. They passed away in the earthquake too,\" says her uncle, Khalil al-Sawadi, rocking the smiling baby girl in her swing. \"They would often spend time at ours. She doesn't give us a hard time at all.\" On 6 February, a devastating earthquake ripped through south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria, killing more than 44,000 people. Just after the devastating quake hit Jindayris, Afraa's mother went into labour and gave birth under the rubble of her home. She died before rescuers found them. Baby Afraa was the only member of her immediate family to survive - her father, Abu Rudaina, and her four siblings died, along with her mother. \"We saw that Abu Rudaina's house had collapsed,\" says Khalil. \"My wife started screaming: 'My brother, my brother'.\" Khalil recalls vividly the moment he pulled Afraa from under the rubble: \"The roof had fallen over them. Someone called me and said they found a woman's body. As soon as I arrived, I started digging, then I heard a voice. It was baby Afraa still attached to her mother. We were determined to save her, we knew she would be the only memory left of her family.\" A dramatic video of the rescue was shared on social media and went viral. The baby was taken to hospital and was initially given the name Aya, which means miracle in Arabic. The doctor looking after her said she had bumps and bruises and was barely breathing. Six months on, those injuries are no longer visible. \"Immediately after the earthquake she had some chest problems because of the dust from the rubble, but now her health is great,\" says Khalil. \"I took her to the doctor to check up on her and now her health is 100%.\" But the past six months have been tough. When Afraa was in hospital, thousands of people around the world offered to adopt her, so Khalil and his wife Hala had to prove they really were related before they were allowed to take care of her. \"I felt that they didn't want to hand Afraa to us,\" he says. Hala had to do a DNA test and waited \"almost 10 days\" to hear back. There had been so much interest in Afraa's story that Khalil and his family worried as they waited for the DNA results, that someone might try to kidnap her. They spent as much time as they could at the hospital and took extra precautions. \"Both the civil and military police helped us protect her,\" he says. \"There were lots of them. They stayed in the room next to Afraa and watched over her day and night.\" Eventually, the DNA results confirmed Hala was a blood relative - the sister of Afraa's father - and the little girl was discharged from hospital. One of the first things Khalil and Hala did was to give her a new name: Afraa, after her mother. \"She is one of my children now,\" says Khalil. \"I can't spend too much time away from her. \"When she grows up, I will tell her what happened and show her the pictures of her mother, father and her siblings. We buried them the next day in a nearby village called Hajj Iskandar, where the Civil Defence had dug mass graves.\" Hala had been pregnant at the same time as Afraa's mum and three days after Afraa was born, Hala also gave birth to a baby girl. They called her Ataa after another auntie who died in the earthquake. But their home in Jindayris was so badly damaged that they couldn't live there any more. \"It has big cracks and is not safe,\" says Khalil. \"I lost my home and my car, it was like going back to square one. I can't even afford to send my kids to school.\" They lived in a tent in a camp for two months where life was \"extremely difficult, it was very hot and we had two babies to take care of\". The family finally managed to find a house to rent where they now live, but they are afraid they won't be able to stay for long. \"It is very expensive and I don't know if we will be able to keep it much longer as the owner needs it,\" says Khalil. People have offered to help them move to the UAE or the UK but he has turned them down. \"Honestly, I was still worried [if I go abroad] they might take Afraa away from us.\" He reminds us that \"there are people living under worse conditions in Jindayris\". His hometown was one of the worst-hit by the earthquake and thousands of other families found themselves in a similar predicament. In all, more than 50,000 people died in Syria and Turkey - at least 4,500 in north-west Syria, where an estimated 50,000 families were also displaced, according to the UN. Delivering aid to the four million people living in this rebel-held area of Syria is extremely difficult, where most of the residents have already been displaced by the country's 12-year war.

      "title": "New British Humanitarian Medal to honour UK disaster rescuers",
      "text": "A new British medal is being launched to honour people who have responded to major disasters and emergencies, such as earthquakes and floods. Approved by King Charles, the Humanitarian Medal will recognise the efforts of emergency workers and relief teams, including charities, service personnel and health workers. It will honour the \"unsung heroes\" in emergencies both abroad and in the UK. This could be natural disasters, but also war zones and epidemics. Alongside military and civilian honours, the new Humanitarian Medal will recognise those working in the most serious of disasters, including tsunamis, hurricanes and major industrial accidents. The medal could also be for a sustained response to a health crisis, such as the efforts to tackle Ebola in West Africa. Eligibility for the Humanitarian Medal will be for those providing assistance on behalf of the UK government, but it will not be restricted to British nationals, says the Cabinet Office. The medal, with an image of the King on one side and the words \"for humanitarian service\" on the other, will become immediately available, or at least as soon as support is sent to a disaster or catastrophe, whether in the UK or overseas. Earlier this year King Charles went to meet grieving families in London who had lost relatives in the earthquake that hit Syria and Turkey. A Syrian man who had lost his mother, father and other family members told the King of the urgent need for more international rescue teams to reach those trapped below rubble. But the government has faced criticism from aid agencies over its longer-term humanitarian efforts, with its reduction in spending on overseas aid. MPs on the International Development Committee and development agencies have also highlighted that billions from the overseas aid budget is now being spent within the UK, such as for hotel costs for refugees, rather than helping countries overseas. International Development Minister Andrew Mitchell said the humanitarian medal would recognise those who \"show such courage and serve as inspiration in a range of desperate situations\". \"Our work around the world depends on these extraordinary people, and this award honours their outstanding contribution in responding to a major crisis,\" he said.",

      "text": "New signing Lionel Messi has been officially presented to cheering crowds at Inter Miami's DRV PNK Stadium. In a brief address in Spanish, Messi, 36, thanked supporters and said he had the \"same desire\" he always has. The World Cup-winning Argentina forward joins the Major League Soccer (MLS) club on a deal until the end of 2025. He will be reunited with defensive midfielder Sergio Busquets - with whom he played at Barcelona - who has also signed for Miami until 2025. Busquets, too, was formally unveiled during Sunday night's event. Messi entered the pitch via a huge catwalk and was introduced as \"America's number 10, the world's best number 10\". Seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady and four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry also welcomed him to the United States in video messages. \"I really want to start training, to compete,\" Messi said. \"I have the same desire that I always had to compete, to want to win, to help the club continue to grow. \"I am very happy to have chosen to come to play in this city with my family, to choose this project and I have no doubt that we are going to enjoy it a lot. \"We are going to have a good time and very good things are going to happen.\" Don Garber, commissioner of Major League Soccer, said someone of Messi's status choosing to play in the league was a \"transformational moment\", and he hoped the signing would \"shout to the world that this is a soccer nation\". Garber added: \"It's been so many years of developing this league into becoming a player on the global stage, so it's a very momentous night for us.\" The DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale is Inter Miami's temporary stadium and has a capacity of 18,000, making it the joint-smallest in MLS along with San Jose Earthquakes' PayPal Park in California. A temporary grandstand has been erected to allow more fans into the ground. Messi left French champions Paris St-Germain at the end of the 2022-23 season after scoring 32 goals in 75 games across a two-year spell. He turned down lucrative offers from other countries to play in the US - and this is the first time he will play for a non-European club. Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham hailed Messi's signing as a \"dream come true\". \"Leo, we are so proud that you have chosen our club for the next stage in your career,\" he said. Inter Miami's primary owner, American billionaire Jorge Mas, called Messi \"the best player ever to don boots\". Messi is expected to be available to play for Miami against LIGA MX side Cruz Azul on 21 July in their opening match of the Leagues Cup. He reunites with his former Barca and Argentina boss Gerardo Martino after the 60-year-old was appointed manager in June following the sacking of Phil Neville. Lionel Messi: Destiny - watch behind-the-scenes documentary on iPlayer 'A lot of naysayers and doubters, but Miami was able to make it happen' The arrival of Messi in the US has been met with feverish anticipation by the fans of Inter Miami, who only started playing in the Eastern Conference of the MLS in 2020. \"This is a dream come true for anybody to have the best player in the world at their home team,\" said one supporter. \"I'm dreaming right now.\" Another fan said that while she did know and care about the club, it was Argentina legend Messi who was the main attraction. \"[Messi] is everything,\" she said. \"The emotion that he caused us when he won the World Cup is indescribable. This means everything to us.\" The ownership were also praised by fans for their commitment to bringing a huge signing to the south Florida side. \"They have been making promises and keeping promises,\" said a fan. \"They promised world-class soccer and they have been able to provide it. They have been able to deliver. \"We are grateful that Messi has been able to choose Miami. A lot of naysayers and a lot of doubters, but Miami was able to make it happen.\" In June, reports said Messi was offered a deal by Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal worth $1.5bn over three years.external-link With him opting to join Inter Miami instead, one fan felt Messi's signing could take football in America \"to the next level\". He said: \"Much like when Pele joined the New York Cosmos [in 1975], same thing. Bring him up.\"",

      "title": "Terms of Syrian offer on aid deliveries unacceptable, says UN",
      "text": "The United Nations has described as \"unacceptable\" the conditions placed by Syria in an offer to allow aid to keep reaching rebel-held territory. Syria's ambassador to the UN said on Thursday his government would let aid continue entering the country via the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey. Members of the UN Security Council had earlier failed to reach an agreement to keep the border crossing open. Some 4.1 million people in north-west Syria depend on the aid deliveries. In a letter to the UN secretary general, Syrian ambassador Bassam Sabbagh said Damascus had made a \"sovereign decision\" to let aid cross through Bab al-Hawa for the next six months. It would allow deliveries to resume \"in full co-operation and co-ordination with the Syrian government\", he said. But in a document sent to the Security Council and seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the proposal \"contains two unacceptable conditions\". It said that, first, the Syrian government had \"stressed that the United Nations should not communicate with entities designated as 'terrorist'\". Since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011, President Bashar al-Assad has frequently described any rebel groups or opponents of his regime as terrorists. The OCHA also said Damascus also wanted the distribution of all aid in northwest Syria to be supervised and facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). It said the condition was \"neither consistent with the independence of the United Nations nor practical, as the ICRC and SARC are not present\" in the area. However, it did say the Syrian government's offer could be a \"basis for the United Nations to lawfully conduct cross-border humanitarian operations via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing\". On Tuesday, Russia - a key ally of Syria's - used its veto on the Security Council to block a nine-month extension to the UN-brokered agreement allowing aid to move through Bab al-Hawa. Syria and Russia have previously objected to the UN aid delivery mechanism as a violation of Syria's sovereignty, But Russia was then unable to win enough support among the Council's 15 members for its favoured option of a six-month extension. The US - which along with France and the UK had called for a one-year extension - accused Russia of \"an act of utter cruelty\". The offer from the Syrian government was met with concerns that Damascus could be able to control the distribution of aid, and stop it reaching opposition-held areas. \"The priority needs to be getting aid flowing again, fast, to the people who need it - and then getting certainty over its future,\" UK ambassador Barbara Woodward said after Syria's announcement. \"But without UN monitoring, control of this critical lifeline has been handed to the man responsible for the Syrian people's suffering,\" she added. The Bab al-Hawa lifeline has become even more important since a devastating earthquake struck north-west Syria in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families. Despite the impasse over Bab al-Hawa, the UN is still able to use two additional aid crossings that were opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake until 13 August.",

      "title": "Syria seeks to assert control over UN aid deliveries",
      "text": "Syria is to allow UN humanitarian aid into rebel-held territory through its main border crossing which closed amid a political impasse at the UN, its ambassador there has said. Some 4.1 million people in north-west Syria depend on the aid deliveries. The UN Security council, which has authorised deliveries via Bab al-Hawa from Turkey since 2014, failed to agree on Thursday on extending the operation. The UN says it is studying Syria's plan to continue deliveries for six months. Syrian ambassador Bassam Sabbagh said in a letter to the UN secretary general that Damascus had made a \"sovereign decision\" to let aid cross through Bab al-Hawa. It would allow deliveries to resume \"in full co-operation and co-ordination with the Syrian government\", he said. The move has raised fears though that if accepted, it could allow for Syria to control the distribution of the aid. \"The priority needs to be getting aid flowing again, fast, to the people who need it - and then getting certainty over its future,\" UK ambassador Barbara Woodward said after Syria's announcement. \"But without UN monitoring, control of this critical lifeline has been handed to the man responsible for the Syrian people's suffering,\" she added. Syria and Russia - Syria's key ally - have previously objected to the UN aid delivery mechanism as a violation of Syria's sovereignty, having been adopted without Syria's consent. Russia vetoed a nine-month extension for the use of the Bab al-Hawa crossing that 13 of the 15 other council members backed. But it was then unable to muster enough votes for its proposal of six months. The US accused Russia of \"an act of utter cruelty\". The Bab al-Hawa lifeline has become even more important since a devastating earthquake struck north-west Syria in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families. Although the Security Council decision means the UN must immediately stop aid deliveries through Bab al-Hawa, it will be able to continue until 13 August to use two additional border crossings that were opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake.",

      "title": "Fukushima: China extends ban on some Japanese food over wastewater release plan",
      "text": "China says it will maintain a ban on some Japanese food imports over the plan to release water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean. China's customs administration said it would also implement radiation tests on food from other parts of the country. South Korea is also maintaining a similar ban but says the proposed release meets international standards. On Wednesday the UN's nuclear watchdog said it would have \"negligible impact\" on the environment. On Friday Japan's nuclear regulator also gave its approval. In 2011, a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake flooded three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. It is regarded as the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. More than 150,000 people were evacuated from an exclusion zone around the plant, which remains in place. Decommissioning of the plant has also started, but the process could take decades. Meanwhile the equivalent of around 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water has amassed at the nuclear facility, according to Reuters news agency. Storage space for the water is running out, but the plans initiated by the Japanese government and the facility's operator, Tepco, to release the water into the sea have encountered regional criticism - most harshly from China. \"China Customs will maintain a high level of vigilance,\" China's customs authority said. Japan's foreign ministry said it was considering possible measures in response, according to an unnamed official who spoke to AFP news agency. China has already strongly criticised the plan - accusing Japan of treating the ocean like its \"private sewer.\" It has also warned the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) against endorsing it. The agency released a report on Wednesday stating the plan would have a \"negligible\" impact on the environment. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told Reuters he was \"extremely confident\" in his agency's assessment of Japan's proposal. He added that his organisation did not take any sides and that its findings were based on scientific evidence. South Korea, which had previously also criticised the plan, said it was maintaining its ban on imports of seafood from Fukushima and some other Japanese prefectures. Local fishing communities in Japan have also expressed their concerns about the plan and its affects on their livelihoods.",

      "title": "Jenin: Palestinians fear escalation after destructive West Bank assault",
      "text": "The atmosphere in Jenin refugee camp feels like one I have witnessed elsewhere - in Gaza, after wars with Israel. But this is the occupied West Bank; where the dynamics are very different. Now it seems like a fast descent into something far more dangerous is already happening. The destruction in the camp following the Israeli army's biggest assault there in 20 years is massive. As hundreds of troops entered the camp on Monday morning, the army fired missiles from drones - air strikes have not been used in the West Bank for two decades - and tore up roads to clear them of what it said were militants' roadside bombs. Fierce gun battles broke out between the troops and Palestinian militants and continued until Israeli troops withdrew on Tuesday night. Now for the first time in safety since Sunday, thousands of residents pour into the streets to see the destruction themselves. They clamber over rubble, take photos on their phones of the wreckage and compare experiences, pointing out which homes were raided, whose sons have been detained, and where the dead fell. One man walks up to me saying it reminds him of pictures from Turkey and Syria earlier this year - after the earthquake. Cars lie crushed and tossed aside where they were hewn out of the path of Israel's D9 armoured bulldozers. The tarmac is torn up, lying everywhere in huge chunks. We walk along what was underneath the streets: rubble, sand and dust. Many homes have no water or power. Aid volunteers bring crates of bottled water. They join the recovery workers - some driving the few diggers available. One is removing a downed tree from the top of residential building. It shears away part of the facade of a shop on the ground floor, falling perilously close to us. The Israeli armoured convoys pulled out overnight amid intense gunfights with militants. Despite today's calm, everyone fears more is coming. Israel says it will keep doing these kinds of operations \"as long as necessary to uproot terrorism\" while Palestinian militant groups are claiming \"victory\" and vowing revenge. We continue our way through the camp and the funeral processions begin. Thousands of mourners chant as they carry stretchers holding the bodies of some of the 12 Palestinians killed since Monday. Four of them were aged under 18. Israel said it was targeting militants. Columns of people join. As they march, some men are masked and carrying guns; others wear Islamic Jihad headbands and Hamas flags flutter over a nearby building. Anger grips the crowd as it makes its way towards the homes of the dead, where their mothers and wives await. But the displays of firepower - in public at least - feel less intense than previous funerals. I have been coming to Jenin repeatedly over the last year and a half, as a new generation of armed militants has formed, rejecting the ageing Palestinian leadership and shooting at the Israeli army during its growing raids into the city. This is a generation that believes the official Palestinian Authority (PA) sold out on their future and became little more than a security company for Israel's military occupation, which secures the expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, built on the land Palestinians want for a future state and illegal under international law. Less gunfire today, but the frustration only intensifies. Overnight young Palestinian men also clashed with the formal security forces of the PA. Jenin is a city that had already slipped well out of its limited control. Now the institutional remnants of a three-decades old peace process in the occupied West Bank are being tested to destruction. Israel says it will continue to root out what it calls \"a city of refuge for terrorism\" in Jenin, but the Palestinian militant factions say they will intensify their activities. A car-ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that wounded seven Israelis was described by Islamic Jihad as the \"first response\" to what was happening in Jenin. The growing violence is a further sign of the collapse of any political horizons. Some fear that Palestinian cities in the West Bank will see more intensive military attacks and security crackdowns - more akin to the plight of people in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas and blockaded by Israel. More Palestinians reject their own internationally recognised leadership and back armed resistance, while Israel remains in the grip of the most extreme government it has ever known, which has vowed to extend what it calls exclusive Jewish rights to all the land.

      "title": "Fukushima nuclear disaster: UN watchdog approves plan for water release",
      "text": "A UN watchdog has said that Japan's plan to release waste water from the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea complies with international standards. The International Atomic Energy Agency says the release will have a \"negligible\" impact on the environment. The Fukushima facility is running out of storage space for the water, which was used to cool nuclear reactors. Japan's plan has been opposed by China and South Korea. Tokyo has not announced a schedule for the release and the plan still needs approval from a regulator. In 2011, a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake flooded three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. It is regarded as the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. More than 150,000 people were evacuated from an exclusion zone around the plant, which remains in place. Decommissioning of the plant has also started, but the process could take decades. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi released the findings of a two-year safety review on Tuesday, and vowed to continue engaging with Japan after the water is discharged. In May, the agency said that national nuclear regulator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) had shown its ability to make \"accurate and precise measurements\" of the amount of radiation present in the treated water. A final approval from Tepco could come as early as this week. The plant produces 100 cubic metres of waste water daily. Tanks on site can hold 1.3 million cubic metres. Most radioactive elements have been filtered from the water, except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. Tokyo has said the water that will be released into the Pacific Ocean, which has been treated with seawater, has tritium levels well below internationally approved levels. Nuclear power plants around the world regularly release waste water with tritium levels above that of the treated water from Fukushima. But the IAEA's finding will do very little to ease the concerns of the Japanese public and neighbouring countries. China had already strongly criticised Japan's plan and warned the IAEA against endorsing it. South Koreans, on the other hand, have stocked up on sea salt ahead of the water's release, amid food safety fears. Local fishing communities have also fiercely objected, saying it will cause further damage to their reputation.",

      "title": "David Bowie's 1983 shows in Milton Keynes remembered",
      "text": "Forty years ago this weekend tens of thousands of fans gathered to watch David Bowie play three nights at a converted clay pit in the Buckinghamshire countryside. Fans who witnessed the gigs, from front and back of stage, spoke to the BBC about their memories. They came in their thousands from all across the country - with extra train services and coaches laid on to deal with the demand. More than 150,000 descended on the National Bowl in Milton Keynes that sweltering weekend in July 1983, on a tour that saw Bowie play his first live gigs in England in five years. I was among them. My journey, aged 15 and accompanied by a school friend, was on a coach from Cornwall. I didn't know it then, but we were about to witness the artist's transformation to a new level of global superstar. Alongside the die-hard Bowie fans, ska and reggae lovers had turned out to see support act The Beat, joining new romantics, punks and even a contingency of Hell's Angels, from memory. Bowie's new persona seemed to appeal to everyone, and it felt like half the country was there. The three dates, from 1 to 3 July, had been added to the end of the European leg of his Serious Moonlight tour, due to massive demand for tickets following the success of the Let's Dance album and its hit singles, including the title track. The nine-month tour had \"snowballed\", said official photographer Denis O'Regan, eventually featuring 99 dates in over 60 cities across the globe, including a series of massive open-air concerts. The photographer said he had been inspired to work with Bowie after seeing him a decade earlier at the famous Hammersmith Odeon concert, the night before the Bowie retired his Ziggy Stardust incarnation. \"That gig really changed my whole life,\" he said. \"I decided I wanted to go on tour with David Bowie, I also wanted to tour with the Rolling Stones, because they were the biggest band and I wanted to tour with Queen, because they were great, and I ended up touring with them all. \"I approached David with a business plan to produce a book of the tour, which he really liked.\" An early assumption the artist would keep him at arms length, being protective of his image, turned out to be the opposite, he explained. \"He was a very, very warm person and wanted to engage really easily with what I was doing, wanting me to cover every moment.\" His photographs document the transformation of the artist \"from the inside\", he said, \"it was an amazing time to be with him.\" As the tour progressed the photographer said he had to come up with different ways of shooting the star \"to hold David's interest\". \"If it was a shot of the live performance, it had to be very special,\" he said. \"At Milton Keynes, instead of the audience disappearing over the horizon they rise up in front of you, and that's what gave it that epic look.\" The resulting images were featured in US magazines Newsweek and Time \"and of course gave this impression of David being an enormous star playing to huge crowds so that really had quite an effect,\" he said. \"The rest of the world, especially America where David wasn't so big, saw this all happening and suddenly they wanted him, because they were booking into stadiums as well, so the tour took on a different level of magnitude and became a huge thing.\" An 18-year-old Chris Wilson had driven from Norfolk with friends for the first of the three dates, the day after finishing his A level exams. \"The day is still singed on my memory; we had pictures of Bowie stuck in the windows in the back of the car; that's how excited we were,\" he said. \"My god, he was on form and just looked amazing. He was shining and golden, the staging was magical. \"I just remember it being utterly euphoric because we'd waited so long to see him. \"His genius was, even in a massive crowd like that, you felt like he was singing to you, he was looking at you.\" A Manchester University student at the time, Dr Joan Keating said she had gone to the gig with friends as a birthday treat. \"I made a strapless dress out of yellow broderie anglaise and wore it with elbow length white lace gloves,\" she said. \"I remember that Bowie was very far away from the section that we were in, but that I felt grown up and glamorous and somehow in exactly the place that I was meant to be as a 20-year-old textiles student. \"I can still 'feel' the music.\" To a 16-year-old Nick De Marco, attending the gig with school friends from London had felt like a \"big expedition\". \"There were so many tens of thousands of people ahead of us, and all being young kids we didn't really think of getting to the front, but it was all very exciting,\" he said. \"But it is incredible when you do see the pictures of the enormity of that gig, and you just think, god, I was in there somewhere.\" Like many of us he also remembered the slow train journey back to London, arriving at Euston in the early hours. \"There was no way we could get home, so we all just slept on the concourse, it was full of hundreds of people doing the same thing,\" said Mr De Marco, who is now a lawyer. \"It was like there had been an earthquake or something.\" A 15-year-old Sam Rosser had travelled from Staffordshire for the gig, and said she felt \"slightly hysterical\" at times. \"I will never, ever forget that day, ever. I feel so lucky to have had that experience. I miss him so much.\" Dave Willis, then 17 years old and living in Woking in Surrey, describes phoning in sick to his employers in order to go to the concert with a colleague. \"Being provincial boys, we used to go to civic halls and leisure centres to see bands, so the thought of going to this great big bowl to see Bowie, and The Beat was just great,\" he said. \"It was so hot and of course we hadn't taken anything with us - we just got there and got down the front and then had to stay there, so we just spent all day in the sun with nothing to drink. \"I remember everything just being brilliant; every act was on point, and he came on and just blew everyone away.\" O'Regan now has a gallery in Hammersmith in west London, where he exhibits and sells limited edition prints and his published photography books, and looks back with great fondness at the time he spent with Bowie. \"On the tour we would have a slide show in my room once I got the pictures developed [as used to happen with rolls of camera film], and I really used to enjoy that,\" he said. \"I used to love it just me and David, and we often used to go out just me and him. \"It was way beyond what I ever expected. I knew at the time how lucky I was.\" Ricochet: David Bowie 1983, Denis O'Regan's deluxe box set including five books, signed and numbered prints, and exclusive vinyl, will soon be available to buy individually in unboxed collections. As the person who has photographed Bowie more than anyone, O'Regan is also working on a new book detailing his photographs of the artist across a 20-year period.

The British Geological Survey (BGS) said the tremor's epicentre was 7.3km (4.5 miles) below Tean. It is the largest of 21 earthquakes to strike the UK in the past two months. The BGS said people had reported \"an initial rumbling, then a bang\" with what \"felt more like a shunt, like something had hit something\". People as far as 20km (12.5 miles) from the epicentre took to social media to describe the effects. Kelvin Evans, in Upper Tean, said he heard a \"very loud, weird, spooky noise, that seemed to vibrate the front of the house.\" Another Tean resident, Jenni Brown, said she thought a vehicle had veered off the road and bumped the side of her house. Sarah Firth reported \"a strange noise and huge vibration\" in Alsager, Cheshire and Janet Buckley felt the ground shake in Great Haywood, Stafford. Mark Begg, 30, said he was at home in Uttoxeter when he felt \"a very large shake\". After checking the house and finding no signs of damage he concluded \"it was most likely a mini-earthquake\". Tom, 38, in Cheadle said: \"I was sitting watching an episode of Only Connect with my wife on YouTube and as we opened another bottle of wine the whole house shook. \"I thought either one of the children had fallen out of bed or something else had happened.\" The BGS records and locates between 200 and 300 earthquakes in the UK each year with the majority only detected by sensitive instruments. The strongest UK earthquake recorded by the survey was a 6.1 magnitude tremor in the North Sea, about 75 miles from Great Yarmouth, in June 1931.

The quake, believed to have been between magnitude 5.2 and 5.8 was felt from Rennes in the north-west to Bordeaux in the south-west. Homes, schools and churches were damaged, with hundreds of buildings declared uninhabitable. Earthquakes above magnitude five are unusual in France, with the last affecting the country in November 2019. Two people were injured in the town of Deux-Sevres following Friday's tremor. The Charente-Maritime region just north of Bordeaux was particularly affected. In La Laigne, the local fire service chief Didier Marcaillou warned the church had become \"completely unusable\" and a top government regional official said that most of the houses in the town centre were affected. \"The school will have to be closed as a precaution,\" Nicolas Basselier said. One woman cried as she told local station BFMTV that she had could no longer live in her home. \"I wouldn't wish this on anyone,\" the woman, named Christine said. \"In my son's room you can fit your entire hand through the crack in the wall.\" Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne described the earthquake as \"unusual\" and expressed her solidarity with those \"who may have been worried\". \"We will obviously ensure that everyone has access to rehousing,\" Ms Borne said. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the government would initiate an accelerated natural disaster recognition procedure to help quickly assess the structural damage to buildings.",

      "title": "Mayon: The people constantly fleeing a Philippine volcano",
      "text": "Monet Oxales arranges packs of crisps and sweet bread for sale as the smell of raw fish wafts from a maze of tents. It's an hour before noon and the familiar lunchtime rush is playing out in a shelter, instead of her village near the Philippines' angry Mayon volcano. Thousands in the Philippines' Albay province in the northeast peninsula of Bicol are living in shelters for an indefinite period as Mayon, the country's most picturesque, yet highly active volcano, oozes lava and remains under watch for a possible violent eruption. Spending weeks or even months on end in evacuation centres has become routine for those who have lived under Mayon's shadow all their lives. For Ms Oxales, this means bringing her mini grocery store with her. For those who need to do their laundry, she also sells small packs of detergent. The 40-year-old has lived in a shelter five times in her life. Since arriving about a week ago, she has transferred tents twice. Ms Oxales hopes the volcano will calm down soon so that her family can return to the only piece of land that they own. \"We can't totally leave our village because we're poor,\" she tells the BBC, as she watches over her five year-old daughter, who has been running a fever since they left their home in the farming town of Guinobatan. \"Our place is beautiful. Mayon eruptions are the only major problems we have. It's a natural disaster. We can't do anything but to temporarily leave our village.\" She worries that her children will get sick from inhaling volcanic ash constantly. Potable water in her shelter comes in trickles so she makes sure to keep one red pail full for her family of four. They are also in need of electricity to keep their mobile phones and rechargeable fans juiced up. \"What can we do but to endure this?\" she asks. In another shelter, Benjamin Nasol, a motor taxi driver, worries about the small pig farm he left behind. Every night he returns to his home in Camalig town for a few hours to ensure that his animals are fed and safe from thieves. \"We are used to it,\" the 53-year-old tells the BBC. He says the sight of molten rocks cascading from Mayon's crater does not scare him one bit as it is his third time in a volcano shelter. \"Even if you are weary or exhausted, you need to do your obligations in the village, then you come back to your family here in the evacuation centre,\" he says. State scientists flagged increased activity on Mayon in early June, after they observed more frequent earthquakes and rockfalls from the crater. It is now under the third-highest alert based on a five-tier scale that measures the probability of an explosive eruption. Technically, Mayon is erupting, albeit at a slow pace. From a hilltop observatory, volcanologist Paul Alanis looks for visual cues that could upgrade the alert level. Those alerts then determine how many people will need to be evacuated. When Level 3 was declared on 8 June, at least 13,000 people were immediately moved to shelters. Several thousands more were evacuated in the succeeding days. For what's invisible to the naked eye, Mr Alanis uses a seismometer to measure movements underground. The most telling sign that Mayon was acting up was the swelling of a dome on its crater that was left by its last lava eruption in 2018, Mr Alanis says. That so-called lava dome appeared to be growing as early as April this year. There was a sense of anxiety in the observatory last week. \"At any time, the condition of the volcano could escalate. We had to prioritise to get the people out,\" Mr Alanis tells the BBC. The volcanologist's job also includes explaining what's happening in Mayon to the provincial governor and disaster response officials so that they can prepare accordingly. The slow-moving lava flows could mean two things, Mr Alanis says. It's either there's not enough hot gas inside the volcano for an explosive eruption or that the molten rock's path is clogged, preventing gas from escaping to the surface. \"We need to find other reasons why is that happening. But right now, I can't really tell,\" he says. \"At the moment, there's no technology that can predict when a volcano would erupt.\" The Philippines has 24 active volcanoes and is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, so-called for its history of volcanic activity. On the same week as the evacuations, a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that's unrelated to Mayon struck south of the capital, Manila, resulting in the temporary evacuation of office towers and high-rise buildings. But Mayon is the most fabled of the country's volcanoes, thanks to its near-perfect shape. It's the world's most conical volcano, according to Guinness. The fiery-red glow of lava on the crater has attracted throngs of tourists. It has also inspired internet memes about Daragang Magayon - a beautiful maiden from local Bicol folklore - and about Filipino Australian beauty queen Catriona Gray, who won the 2018 Miss Universe crown wearing a gown in the colour of Mayon's lava flows. For Zaira San Pascual, life in the shelter is more difficult because she had to move her late father's wake to the tent village. The 39-year-old Manila office worker was on the bus to Bicol when her family phoned her to say that they were moving to a shelter. \"How could we do it?\" she remembers asking herself in panic. Once she settled in, she realised that the situation was not as bad as the ones she experienced when she was a kid. \"You'll see people smiling, laughing, joking around. It's their coping mechanism, their way of not thinking about how grim their condition is here,\" she says. In the calm of night, people at the shelter have no choice but to wait and keep themselves entertained. They huddle in small groups to swap jokes on who has become the Marites - neighbourhood gossip - in their tent village. While evacuation from inside danger zones is mandatory, there are still those who refuse to leave their homes, like 72-year-old Roger Asilo. Mr Asilo hid behind a tree to avoid being hauled on board a lorry that transferred Guinobatan villagers to shelters. Over the decades, he feels he has learnt when the volcano is acting up enough for him to pack his bags. His son is also staying behind to look after him. Mr Asilo says he prefers to look after two pigs that a friend left in his care for a fee. At night, he watches the glowing lava flows seated on a bamboo bench outside his home. \"Every time I look at the volcano spewing lava, I always pray that it would stop,\" he tells the BBC. \"I am scared but I am prepared.\"",

      "title": "Silvio Berlusconi's big footprint in Europe",
      "text": "Flamboyant, controversial Silvio Berlusconi - a four-time prime minister and a key coalition partner in Italy's current government - was envied and admired, loathed and derided in equal measure for many, many years. Nicknamed Il Cavaliere - the Knight - he will not easily be forgotten at home. And he leaves an indelible Berlusconi-shaped stamp on European politics too. I followed his political career from the start - later as a journalist but firstly as a student - writing a university dissertation entitled \"Il cammino inarrestabile di Silvio Berlusconi - The unstoppable rise of Silvio Berlusconi\" after he won his first election back in 1994. Berlusconi quite simply set off a political earthquake in Europe that year - the aftershocks of which will still reverberate long after his state funeral on Wednesday. It seemed revolutionary back in the 1990s to have a business tycoon, former cruise ship crooner and generally screamingly obvious non-career politician at the helm of important EU and Nato military alliance member Italy. That was a time of political deepening of the European project focused in Brussels, but Silvio Berlusconi pushed a more nationalist, \"Italy First\" type of narrative. I was informed by someone in the room that he once told EU leaders at a summit they should speak more about women and football instead. At home, Berlusconi jumped into coalition government with the post-fascist far-right - until then a taboo in post-war Italy - rendering them more socially acceptable as a result. He was intentionally politically incorrect, claiming to speak the language of \"ordinary people\". He was also unapologetic about using his media empire as an advantage over political opponents. He displayed a blatant disregard for the judiciary too, later attempting to change Italian law to avoid prosecution himself. Is Berlusconi's political playbook sounding familiar at all? In many ways, he is the father of modern day populist nationalism in Europe. Ingredients of his political cocktail are evident in numerous ambitious right-leaning politicians and political movements across the continent. Think: Hungary's Victor Orban - who publicly mourned Mr Berlusconi's death on Monday, as well as more than one Austrian government, Marine Le Pen of France, and more. You could also draw parallels further afield - with former US President Donald Trump, for example, whom Mr Berlusconi admired. He had a penchant for strongmen politicians, such as Vladimir Putin, who he was great friends with. He is even said to have gifted the Russian leader with a duvet cover festooned with both men's faces. On hearing of Mr Berlusconi's death on Monday, President Putin described him as a \"dear person, a true friend\". A stark contrast to his often spiky relationship with Italy's traditional friends, Germany and France. That closeness to Moscow worried Italy's allies, especially after the invasion of Ukraine, when Mr Berlusconi was back in coalition government. In Brussels, at the European Union headquarters, he was widely viewed with derision and disdain. Despite the rhetoric, hyperbole and almost relentless optimist political shtick - even when Italy was hit by the 2008 economic crisis - Berlusconi failed to improve his country's fortunes or even radically change Italy. Instead, the real change he brought about was influencing and emboldening a new generation of ambitious politicians in the wider European political arena.",

      "title": "Mayon: Thousands evacuated as Philippine volcano oozes lava",
      "text": "Around 13,000 people have been evacuated in north-east Philippines as the country's most famous volcano, Mayon, continued to ooze lava. Riding lorries and buffalo-drawn carriages, people living within the \"permanent danger zone\" or six-kilometre radius fled to shelters. Known for its \"perfect\" conical shape, Mayon started spewing lava last week. But evacuations only began over the weekend as volcanic activity intensified, setting of alerts. More people could be evacuated if Mayon's unrest intensifies in the coming days, said Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist. It is currently under the third highest warning in a five-tier system that forecasts the threat of a hazardous or explosive eruption. It is technically erupting, albeit at a slow pace, with lava oozing from the crater, scientists say. Located in a farming peninsula called Bicol, Mayon is among the country's most active volcanoes. It has grown restive in recent weeks with more frequent earthquakes and rocks falling from its crater. \"There's the danger of a fast-moving current of volcanic gases and rocks from the crater,\" Bacolcol told local media. \"It will be difficult to outrun those currents.\" An eruption in 1814 killed 1,200 people and buried an entire town. But the perimeter was declared off limits, resulting in fewer casualties after recent eruptions in 2013 and 2018. As Mayon glowed a fiery red, tourists have also begun to camp out in hilltops to witness the volcanic spectacle. Mayon, which Guinness describes as the world's \"most conical\" volcano, is a tourist favourite. Local officials have designated viewing points where thrill-seekers can marvel at its glowing crater. \"Last night, Mayon again put on a show as lava flowed from its crater,\" Eugene Escobar, a disaster response official in the region, said on Monday in a TV interview. Philip Balselle, a French tourist, told ABS-CBN News that he felt lucky that his Philippine holiday this year coincided with Mayon acting up. He joined about a dozen tourists at a lookout point in a nearby town. \"It's the first time in my life that I'm seeing Mayon, and there's volcanic activity,\" said Filipino tourist Joseph Palasigue from the capital Manila, which is around half a day's drive away. Mayon's beauty is part of Filipino folklore pop culture. It's name is derived from the local word for beautiful lady, daragang mayon. A Filipina beauty queen, Catriona Gray, won the 2018 Miss Universe competition wearing a gown that is inspired by lava flowing down Mayon's slopes. Her mother hails from Albay province, where the volcano is located. Mayon is among the Philippines' 24 active volcanoes. In recent days, two others - Taal and Kanlaon - have also been put under close watch for signs of unrest. While recent eruptions have not directly resulted in many deaths, powerful typhoons in the past have triggered volcanic mudflows that proved fatal. In 2006, Typhoon Durian washed volcanic debris from Mayon's slopes, burying villages and killing about 200 people. At least 10 people were killed in volcanic mudslides from Super Typhoon Goni in 2020. Over the weekend, a powerful typhoon from the Pacific missed the Mayon area.",

      "title": "The women fighting Japan’s sexual violence stigma",
      "text": "Rina Gonoi had two dreams. To be a soldier, and to compete in the Olympics as a judo player. She started judo when she was four years old, trained by her brother, and was 11 when she first saw soldiers in action. The armed forces, known in Japan as the Self-Defence Forces (SDF), had helped Ms Gonoi and her family in an evacuation centre after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster. The 23-year-old is from Higashi-Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture - the area worst hit by that catastrophe. Female soldiers were part of the aid effort. \"They gave us food and ran a soup kitchen,\" Ms Gonoi says. \"They were back and forth bringing hot water for us so we could have a bath. I looked at them and thought 'What a wonderful job.' I thought I would like to work for society - for the people.\" Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of sexual assault Both her dreams were within reach when she joined Japan's army, the Ground Self-Defence Force (GSDF). Both were shattered by sexual harassment which she experienced \"on a daily basis\" when she joined her unit after training. \"My breasts were rubbed. I was kissed on the cheek, groped, or grabbed from behind in the hallway - colleagues or superiors would rub themselves against me with people watching,\" she said. \"Often, I was told things like, 'Give me a blow job'.\" Colleagues made remarks about her body, she says: about her breasts being big or small or that her body was large. August 2021 was a dark turning point. During a training exercise in the mountains, three of Ms Gonio's male colleagues called her into a tent, where they'd been drinking. \"They were talking about a martial arts technique which involved choking someone and putting them to the ground. They said, 'Gonoi try it' - they pinned me to the bed and choked me.\" Ms Gonoi said the three men forcibly spread her legs open and alternately and repeatedly pressed their crotches against her. Around a dozen colleagues were around she said, adding that no-one stopped the three men: \"Many were laughing.\" \"I was filled with despair. I thought, 'How could I live after my body and soul have been tainted?'\" She reported the incident to her superiors but was unable to obtain any witness testimony, and her complaint was dismissed. Later, the three men were referred to prosecutors on suspicion of indecent assault by the GSDF police unit, but the case was dropped for lack of evidence. In the end Ms Gonoi felt she had no choice but to quit and go back home. \"I was exhausted mentally and physically and isolated myself in my house,\" she said. When she decided to go public with her story, Ms Gonoi's family and those around her were against it. In Japan's male-dominated society most sexual violence victims are shamed into silence. And those who speak out face a fierce backlash. A recent survey showed that more than 70% of sexual assaults in Japan go unreported. When Ms Gonoi decided to speak out, she knew it wasn't going to be easy. She was taking on a Japanese military institution. She shared what happened to her on YouTube. Her story was a rare case that captured the nation's and the media's attention. Ms Gonoi says that other women and men shared their stories of sexual violence with her, both in the military and elsewhere. She also collected more than 100,000 signatures for a petition calling on the defence ministry to investigate her case. But she also faced a backlash. \"Some would say 'You are ugly' - others would comment on my cauliflower ears, because I'd been doing Judo. Some would say 'Are you actually a man?'\" she said. \"When I was collecting signatures for the petition, I got a threatening email saying, 'I'll kill you if you go any further.'\" The last case that garnered this much attention was in 2019, when Japanese journalist Shiori Ito filed and won her civil lawsuit seeking damages from a prominent reporter who she said had raped her. It was also the same year that the Flower Demo movement started. On the 11th day of every month since April 2019, groups of sexual violence victims and their supporters have gathered throughout Japan in public spaces to protest unjust acquittals of sexual crimes, and call for changes to the country's sexual violence law. Problems with the existing law were highlighted by not guilty verdicts in four cases in 2019. In one of the trials, a father accused of raping his 19-year-old daughter was acquitted even though the court acknowledged that he had had sex with her against her will. The prosecution's case, that the man took advantage of the daughter's inability to resist the sexual attack, was rejected. \"I started the Flower Demo because I was angry,\" Minori Kitahara told the BBC after one of the gatherings in Tokyo. \"I also felt many other women's anger. But there's no place to speak out.\" The gathering in central Tokyo was small, but significant, and quite moving. Some people were carrying placards: one said \"Sexual abuse is unforgivable\" in Japanese, while another written in English said, \"Consent is everything\". The Flower Demos have become a symbol of defiance against silence. A woman held a microphone and, through her scarf and mask, you could still see how emotional she was as she told the crowd how her father had sexually abused her as a teenager. Men and women were in tears, including Ms Kitahara. In February, the Japanese government approved a bill to raise the age of sexual consent from 13 to 16, as part of reforms to the country's sexual violence penal code. Under the current law, a victim bears the onus of proving not only that there was no consent, but also that there was \"assault or intimidation\" or other factors that made it impossible for them to put up resistance. \"I think the law is very discriminatory… Compared to other countries, it still disadvantages female victims. When I think about all those victims who could not speak out, I cannot help but think the law itself was a crime against victims,\" Ms Kitahara said. \"I know [the age of consent] is about to change to 16 but... the fact it stayed at 13 for this long is a big problem.\" Ms Kitahara thinks that because the Japanese government is made up mostly of \"old men\" it makes it very difficult for them to understand what women go through. The public attention that Rina Gonoi's case garnered pushed the military to conduct an internal probe. Last December, five servicemen were fired, and the unit commander was suspended for six months. The rare investigation across the defence ministry found more than 100 other complaints of harassment, according to officials. The ministry also issued an apology to Ms Gonoi. She said that she wants to prevent this from happening again to anyone and that the government was also responsible \"for neglecting the case.\" \"I want each [SDF] member to be protected,\" she said. Earlier this year, Ms Gonoi filed a civil lawsuit against the five perpetrators and the Japanese government, seeking 5.5 million yen ($40,000; £32,000) in damages from the men for causing her mental distress, and an additional 2 million yen from the state for its failure to prevent abuse. I asked her why, having experienced so many attacks since she went public, she was pursuing this lawsuit. She hesitates. You can tell none of this is easy. \"I love the SDF so much,\" she said. \"They helped us during the [2011] disaster. This was the last thing I wanted to do. \"I just think this is not right. I still get flashbacks of what happened. It's cost me so much.\" In March, Fukushima prosecutors indicted three former members of Japan's GSDF on suspicion of indecent assault in relation to Ms Gonoi's case. Tweeting after the indictment, Ms Gonoi said she felt her \"work had not been in vain\" and that she hopes the three \"reflect in full and atone for their crimes\". \"I've spent a long time feeling totally unable to accept why none of them were being prosecuted. Every day has been a struggle,\" she wrote. Ms Gonoi says she wants to travel and move on with her life. \"I'm a fun-loving person. I like to make people laugh and I like to smile. I want to show people that I can still live positively and enjoy my life. I want to live as I am - I want to be myself.\"",

      "title": "Religious US broadcaster Pat Robertson dies at 93",
      "text": "Evangelical Christian leader Pat Robertson, who ran for president as a Republican, has died at the age of 93. He was one of the driving forces of a movement to increase the influence of the religious right in US politics. He founded the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1960 and helped grow it into a cable media empire. For decades, Robertson hosted a CBN talk show called the 700 Club that combined religious news and political commentary with light entertainment. CBN announced the news of his death on Thursday. No cause was given. Robertson also founded the Christian Coalition, the organisation that grew to be a pivotal player in Republican politics starting in the 1980s. It provided endorsements and financial and organisational support to candidates who echoed their views on hot-button social issues like abortion, religious liberty and \"traditional\" values. In 1988, Robertson campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination. He finished second in the Iowa caucuses behind Kansas Senator Robert Dole, with the the support of the state's large evangelical community. Robertson's White House run faltered after eventual nominee and president George HW Bush won the New Hampshire primary. Despite the defeat, Robertson's campaign - he came top in four state-nominating contests - demonstrated that evangelical Christians were a growing force in Republican politics. The evangelical leader would go on to become a kingmaker in Republican politics for decades. Robertson's brand of religious-infused politics frequently generated controversy. He was sharply criticised for appearing to blame American cultural liberalism - including the gay rights movement and abortion - for the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. In 2010, he claimed a devastating earthquake in Haiti was because its people made a \"pact with the devil\" during their fight for independence from France. After Donald Trump was elected president, Robertson said those who opposed him were \"revolting against what God's plan is for America\".",

      "text": "At least 42 people have died in Haiti after torrential rain caused widespread flooding at the weekend, emergency officials say. Another 11 people are still missing, and more than 13,000 are displaced after their homes were damaged. The worst hit city is Léogâne, south-west of the capital Port-au-Prince, where three rivers bursts their banks. Overall, half of all the departments in the impoverished Caribbean island nation are affected. Phania Cange's home in Léogâne was swept away in the floods. She managed to save one of her children but her five-year-old died in the flooding: \"I risked losing two (children), but God left the other one hanging in a tree.\" Léogâne Mayor Ernson Henry said city residents were \"desperate\". \"They have lost everything. The waters have ravaged their fields, washed away their livestock,\" he told the AFP news agency. There are fears that the number of dead will rise further. Prime Minister Ariel Henry said his government - together with international partners - was \"taking urgent measures\" to deal with the disaster. The World Food Programme said that the organisation would start providing hot meals to those displaced. Local TV has shown pictures of people wading through vast streams of brown water. The country's infrastructure has been damaged by several devastating earthquakes. Rescue operations are made harder by Haiti's ongoing problem with criminal gangs, which control many areas.",

      "text": "Police in Japan have arrested a YouTuber and former MP over threats he allegedly made to celebrities. Yoshikazu Higashitani, known on YouTube as GaaSyy, is famous for his celebrity gossip videos. Local media said he returned to Japan from the UAE, two months after Tokyo police issued his arrest warrant. He is accused of threatening to defame an actor, an entrepreneur and a designer between February and August last year. He is also suspected of obstructing the designer's business activities. Mr Higashitani repeatedly ignored requests to return to Japan and voluntarily submit himself to police questioning. Tokyo police had been sending investigators to the UAE since May, and urging authorities there to extradite him to Japan. Japan's foreign minister ordered him to return his passport after Tokyo police obtained his arrest warrant in March, but Mr Higashitani said he'd lost it. His passport expired the following month. Earlier this year, he became the first lawmaker in Japanese history to be kicked out of parliament without ever entering it. Mr Higashitani was one of two members elected from the Seijika-joshi-48 party - a single-issue party calling for reforms to Japan's public broadcaster. During his seven months in office, the social media personality refused to leave his home in Dubai and did not attended a single legislative session. At the time, Japanese media reported that he'd refused to attend parliament because he feared being arrested over fraud allegations, and defamation claims from celebrities. Legislators demanded that Mr Higashitani fly to Tokyo to deliver an in-person apology in the chamber for his absence, but he failed to show up at the plenary session. Instead, he announced on his YouTube channel that he was going to Turkey - and that he was planning to donate his salary to the Turkish earthquake relief. His absence angered the Senate - whose members unanimously voted for his expulsion.",

      "title": "Turkish election victory for Erdogan leaves nation divided",
      "text": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters celebrated well into the night after Turkey's long-time president secured another five years in power. \"The entire nation of 85 million won,\" he told cheering crowds outside his enormous palace on the edge of Ankara. But his call for unity sounded hollow as he ridiculed his opponent Kemal Kilicdaroglu - and took aim at a jailed Kurdish leader and pro-LGBT policies. The opposition leader did not explicitly concede victory. Complaining of \"the most unfair election in recent years\", Mr Kilicdaroglu said the president's political party had mobilised all the means of the state against him. President Erdogan ended with just over 52% of the vote based on near-complete unofficial results - almost half the electorate in this deeply polarised country did not back his authoritarian vision of Turkey. Ultimately Mr Kilicdaroglu was no match for the well-drilled Erdogan campaign, even if he took the president to a run-off second round for the first time since the post was made directly elected in 2014. But he barely dented his rival's first-round lead, falling more than two million votes behind. The president made the most of his victory, with an initial speech to supporters atop a bus in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul, followed after dark by a balcony address from his palace to an adoring crowd that he numbered at 320,000 people. \"It is not just us who won, Turkey won,\" he declared, calling it one of the most important elections in Turkish history. He taunted his opponent's defeat with the words \"Bye, bye, bye, Kemal\" - a chant that was also taken up by his supporters in Ankara. Mr Erdogan poured scorn on the main opposition party's increase in its number of MPs in the parliament vote two weeks before. The true number had fallen to 129, he said, because the party had handed over dozens of seats to its allies. He also condemned the opposition alliance's pro-LGBT policies - which he said was in contrast with his own focus on families. Although the final results are not confirmed, the Supreme Election Council said there was no doubt who had won. It is highly unusual for the palace complex to be opened to the public - but so was this result, extending his period in power to a quarter of a century. Supporters came from all over Ankara to taste the victory. There were Islamic chants and some laid Turkish flags on the grass to pray. For a night Turkey's economic crisis was forgotten and one supporter, Seyhan, said it was all a lie: \"Nobody is hungry. We are very happy with his economy policies. He will do even better in the next five years.\" But the president admitted that tackling inflation was Turkey's most urgent issue. The question is whether he is prepared to take the necessary measures to do so. At an annual rate of almost 44%, inflation seeps into everyone's lives. The cost of food, rent and other everyday goods has soared, exacerbated by Mr Erdogan's refusal to observe orthodox economic policy and raise interest rates. The Turkish lira has hit record lows against the dollar and the central bank has struggled to meet surging demand for foreign currency. \"If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter capital controls,\" warns Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc university in Istanbul. Economics was far from the minds of Erdogan supporters, who spoke of their pride at his powerful position in the world and his hard line on fighting \"terrorists\", by which they meant Kurdish militants. President Erdogan has accused his opposite number of siding with terrorists, and criticised him for promising to free a former co-leader of Turkey's second largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP. Selahattin Demirtas has been languishing in jail since 2016, despite the European Court of Human Rights ordering his release. Mr Erdogan said while he was in power Mr Demirtas would stay behind bars. He also promised to prioritise rebuilding in areas hit by February's twin earthquakes and bring about the \"voluntary\" return of a million Syrian refugees. Crowds flocked to Istanbul's Taksim Square, and many came from the Middle East and the Gulf. Palestinians from Jordan wrapped Turkish flags around their shoulders and a Tunisian visitor, Alaa Nassar, said Mr Erdogan had not just made improvements to his own country, \"he is also supporting Arabs and the Muslim world\". For all the celebrations, the idea of unity in this polarised country seems farther away than ever. Since a failed coup in 2016, Mr Erdogan has abolished the post of prime minister and amassed extensive powers, which his opponent had pledged to roll back. One voter outside an Ankara polling station on Sunday said he wanted to see an end to the brain drain that began with the post-coup purge. There is a risk that it may now intensify. Turkey's opposition will now have to regroup ahead of local elections in 2024. Mr Kilicdaroglu's party has two popular mayors running Ankara and Istanbul - and one of them may have had a better chance of winning the presidential race.

      "title": "Turkish election: Erdogan and Kemal Kilicdaroglu clash in desperate race for votes",
      "text": "The last hours of Turkey's presidential race have turned increasingly sour as Recep Tayyip Erdogan bids to extend his 20 years in power by five more. Ahead of Sunday's run-off vote, opposition rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu has courted nationalist votes by vowing to expel millions of Syrian refugees. The president accused him of hate speech - and said a Kilicdaroglu victory would be a win for terrorists. The opposition candidate trailed in the first round by 2.5 million votes. The president is favourite, but his rival believes the margin could still be bridged - either by the 2.8 million supporters of an ultranationalist candidate who came third or by the eight million voters who did not turn out in the first round. For four hours this week Mr Kilicdaroglu took audience questions on a YouTube channel called BaBaLa TV. The broadcast has reached 23 million views by the latest count and Turkey has a population of 85 million. Youth campaigner Mehtep thinks the YouTube marathon could work: \"Being on BaBaLa TV affected lots of young voters who didn't vote first time around.\" She's a member of the centre-right, nationalist Good party, which has backed the opposition challenger and has the only female leader in Turkish politics in Meral Aksener. The appearance was a smart move for a candidate trying to overcome his rival's inbuilt advantage of controlling about 90% of Turkish media. International monitors say voters may have had a genuine choice, but that Turkey \"did not fulfil the basic principles for holding a democratic election\". President Erdogan has not just amassed sweeping powers in the past six years - he has cracked down on dissent and political opponents have been thrown into jail. The town of Bala, an hour's drive to the south-east of Ankara, is not the sort of place Mr Kilicdaroglu will be able to turn to for support. More than 60% of voters backed President Erdogan there two weeks ago, and there is little sign of any of Turkey's five million first-time voters out on the streets. Over the road from the president's party headquarters, doner kebab shop owner Al Ozdemir says he will vote for another five years of Mr Erdogan. But another shopkeeper refused to tell the BBC who he supported because he feared losing Erdogan supporters as customers. For months Turkey's struggling economy was the number one issue, but as Sunday's run-off has drawn close, the rhetoric has intensified and refugees are at the centre of it. Gone is the unifying 74-year-old opposition leader with his hands cupped into trademark heart-shape. Instead, he is trying to attract voters who backed ultranationalist leader Sinan Ogan two Sundays ago. Although the president won Mr Ogan's backing, the opposition leader secured the support of the anti-immigrant Victory Party, led by Umit Ozdag, whose party won 1.2 million votes. The Victory Party leader said this week Mr Kilicdaroglu had agreed to send back \"13 million migrants\" within a year \"in line with international law\". Turkey is hosting more refugees than any other country, but nowhere near that many. Prof Murat Erdogan, who conducts a regular field study called Syrians Barometer, believes the total number of Syrian refugees and irregular migrants from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan is closer to six or seven million. \"Their discourse is not realistic, physically it's impossible,\" says Prof Erdogan. \"If we talk about [repatriating] voluntarily it's not feasible, and by force it means per day more than 50,000 should be sent back.\" The rhetoric is unpleasant but it might make a difference. As many as 85% of Turks want refugees from Syria's civil war to go home, opinion polls suggest. Both sides have nationalist parties to keep onside, says political scientist Nezih Onur Kuru from Koc university, and Mr Kilicdaroglu is tapping into security concerns felt by many voters, especially young ones. \"He knows the level of perceived threats is too high because of the immigrant crisis and terrorist attacks and wars involving Russia, Syria and Azerbaijan.\" President Erdogan says he is already sending Syrian refugees back and plans to send more. His main partner is the far-right nationalist MHP. And he has gone on the attack too, using a manipulated video at a rally to link his rival to the Kurdish militant PKK, considered a terror group in the West as well as Turkey. On Friday he said a Kilicdaroglu victory meant that \"terrorist organisations\" would win. His target is the big pro-Kurdish HDP party, which backs Mr Kilicdaroglu and which President Erdogan has repeatedly sought to identify with the PKK militants. The HDP denies any such links. The HDP, for now, backs Mr Kilicdaroglu because it wants an end to Turkey's \"one-man regime\". But it has genuine concerns about his alliance with a far-right nationalist. Initially it was thought that President Erdogan could be defeated because of his disastrous handling of Turkey's economy and his poor response to February's earthquakes. And yet almost half of voters backed him. The question is whether Mr Kilicdaroglu's change of tack will work. \"I wanted a change, all my customers wanted a change,\" says Songul in her chicken restaurant in Bala. But ultimately she says they are all sticking with the president because they do not trust his opposite number: \"I'll vote for Erdogan as there's no alternative.\"",

      "title": "Turkey election: What five more years of Erdogan would mean",
      "text": "After two decades in power and more than a dozen elections, Turkey's authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan knows how to work a room. At a taxi drivers' convention in Istanbul, they could not get enough of him. He controlled the crowd like the conductor of an orchestra. They cheered and clapped - and booed the opposition - on cue. The venue was a waterside convention centre in Istanbul, built during his time as mayor of the city. The rally reached a crescendo as the president delivered his parting shot: \"One Nation, One Flag, One Motherland, One State.\" By then, many aging drivers were on their feet, punching the air or raising one arm in a salute. Ayse Ozdogan, a conservatively dressed woman in a headscarf, had come early with her taxi driver husband to hear her leader's every word. A crutch rested on the seat next to her. She struggles to walk but could not stay away. \"Erdogan is everything to me,\" she said, with a broad smile. \"We could not get to hospitals before, but now we can get around easily. We have transportation. We have everything. He has improved roads. He has built mosques. He has developed the country with high-speed trains and underground lines.\" The president's nationalist message appealed to many in the crowd, including Kadir Kavlioglu, aged 58, who has been driving a minibus for 40 years. \"Since we love our homeland and our nation, we are walking steadily behind the president.\" \"We are with him every step of the way,\" he said, \"whether the price of potatoes and onions rises or falls. My dear president is our hope.\" When Turks went to the polls earlier this month, they were not voting with their wallets. Food prices are skyrocketing. Inflation is at a punishing 43%. Yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who controls the economy and much else here - came out in front with 49.5% of the vote. That confounded analysts and taught a lesson here - beware opinion polls. His rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the secular opposition leader, got 44.9%. So, the electorate in this polarised country was split - the two sides implacably opposed but just 4% apart. An ultra-nationalist candidate, Sinan Ogan, took an unexpected 5.2%, pushing the contest to a second round this Sunday. He has now endorsed President Erdogan. Why have most voters stuck with him despite the economic crisis, and the government's slow response to disastrous twin earthquakes in February, which killed at least 50,000 people? \"I think he is the [ultimate] Teflon politician,\" says Professor Soli Ozel, who lectures in international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. \"He also has the common touch. You can't deny it. He exudes power. That's one thing that Kilicdaroglu does not.\" Mr Kilicdaroglu, who is backed by a six-party opposition alliance, used to exude hope, and promise freedom and democracy. But after his first-round disappointment, he made a sharp right turn. Now there is less of the caring grandfather and more of the nationalist hardliner. \"It is a race to the bottom,\" according to one Turkish journalist. \"I am announcing here that I will send all refugees back home once I am elected President, period,\" said Mr Kilicdaroglu at a recent election rally. That includes more than three million Syrians who fled war at home. It is a message that goes down well in Turkey. Whoever is Turkey's next president, nationalism is already a winner here. The voters have elected the most nationalist and conservative parliament ever, in which Mr Erdogan's ruling AK (Justice and Development) Party coalition has retained control. For some young voters it feels like the die has already been cast here. Sitting on a red couch beneath a rainbow flag, Zeynep, 21, and Mert, 23, serve piping hot Turkish tea and worry about the future. Both study psychology at Bogazici University, a respected seat of learning with a history of now-suppressed student protests. Their friendship began at the university's LGBTQ+ club, which has since been closed. Gay pride parades have been banned starting from 2015. During the election campaign, the president has been targeting the community. \"No LGBT people come out of this nation,\" he told a packed rally in the city of Izmir. \"We do not tarnish our family structure. Stand up straight like a man, our families are like that.\" The community is now at growing risk, according to Mert, who has shoulder-length dark hair and earrings. \"Erdogan himself, in every speech, at every event he holds, has started to portray us as targets,\" he said. \"Day by day, the state is making an enemy out of us.\" \"What the government says has an impact on people. You see it reflected in those closest to you, even in your family. If this continues, then what next? We end up always living on alert, always tense, always in fear,\" he said. Zeynep - who has dark eyes and expressive hands - is still hoping for a new era but knows it may not come. \"I am 21 years old and they have been here for 20 years,\" she said. \"I want change and if I don't see that I will be sad and scared. They will attack us more; they will take our rights more. They will ban many more things, I think. But we will still do something, we will still fight.\" On Sunday, voters will go to the polls for the first presidential runoff in their history with their country at a turning point. It is almost 100 years since Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk as a secular republic. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is promising a new \"Turkish century\" if he is re-elected. His supporters say he will deliver more development and a stronger Turkey. His critics say it will be less Ataturk, more Islamisation, and a darker future.",

      "title": "Assad to attend first Arab League summit since start of Syria war",
      "text": "Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is to attend an Arab League summit for the first time since it was suspended from the regional body 12 years ago. Mr Assad was shunned by many fellow leaders after his government's violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests triggered a civil war in which half a million people have been killed. Syria was readmitted this month after states which had backed the opposition accepted his grip on power was secure. They include summit hosts Saudi Arabia. The rapprochement accelerated following the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and north-western Syria in February, when once-hostile powers decided to send humanitarian aid to Syrian government-controlled areas. China also brokered a surprise agreement in March that saw Saudi Arabia restore diplomatic ties with its long-time regional rival Iran, which along with Russia has helped Mr Assad's forces regain control of Syria's biggest cities. Large parts of the country are nevertheless still held by Turkish-backed rebels, jihadists, and Kurdish-led militia fighters supported by the United States. Half of Syria's pre-war population of 22 million have had to flee their homes. Some 6.8 million people are internally displaced, while another 6 million are refugees or asylum-seekers abroad. Even before the earthquake struck an estimated 15.3 million people inside Syria were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance - an all-time high since the war began. President Assad arrived on Thursday night in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, where this year's Arab League summit is taking place. At a meeting of the foreign ministers of the 22 member states on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit declared that he hoped that \"Syria's regaining of its seat is a precursor to the end of its conflict\". Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also welcomed Syria. \"Our world today is facing numerous challenges and difficulties that place us at a crossroads,\" he said. \"It is necessary for us to stand together and try harder to strengthen joint Arab action to meet them.\" But not every country was enthusiastic about Syria's reinstatement. Qatar's foreign minister told a news conference in Doha that it had dropped its opposition only because it did not want to \"deviate from the Arab consensus\". The US meanwhile said it did \"not believe that Syria merits readmission\". \"Our position is clear - we are not going to normalise relations with the Assad regime, and we certainly don't support others doing that as well,\" state department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.",

      "title": "Turkey's Erdogan appears to have upper hand after tense night",
      "text": "Turkey's battle for the presidency looks set to go to a run-off, with both contenders adamant they have victory in their grasp. After 20 years in power, Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood on the balcony of his party HQ saying he was convinced he would win another five. Everything appeared to have fallen into place for his opponent Kemal Kilicdaroglu to win. But incomplete results put him behind the president in the first round. And Mr Erdogan's alliance could also be heading for a majority in parliament. For months, Turkey's disparate opposition parties had pooled their resources in a bid to bring an end to a president who has extended his power dramatically since a failed coup against him in 2016. The election is being watched very closely in the West, because Mr Kilicdaroglu has promised to revive Turkish democracy as well as relations with its Nato allies. On the other hand, President Erdogan's Islamist-rooted government has accused the West of plotting to bring him down. In the early hours of Monday, Mr Kilicdaroglu stood on a stage at his party headquarters in Ankara, flanked by his allies but appearing less confident than before. \"If our nation says second round, we will absolutely win in the second round,\" he said. Supporters outside party headquarters chanted one of his slogans, \"everything will be all right\", but it was not clear for them that it would. He had earlier angrily accused the government of seeking to \"block the will of the people\", by launching repeated challenges in opposition strongholds. Two rising stars in the party, the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, reminded voters that this was a strategy that Mr Erdogan's AK Party had used before. They praised an enormous team of opposition volunteers guarding ballot papers to ensure nothing untoward happened to the votes. Mr Kilicdaroglu, 74, has lost several elections as leader of his Republican People's Party, but this time his message of scrapping the the president's excessive powers struck a chord. Turks have also been reeling from a cost-of-living crisis with 44% inflation, made only worse by Mr Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies. And then the Erdogan government was blamed for a slow rescue response to the double earthquakes in February which killed more than 50,000 people in 11 provinces. And yet, despite a very difficult few months, Turkey's dominant president appears to have the upper hand. Addressing supporters from the balcony he had used for previous victories he announced that \"even though the final results are not in, we are far ahead\". Whether or not he does take a lead into an expected run-off two weeks ahead, the president appears to have defied many pollsters who said his rival had the edge and could even win outright without a run-off. He could also be heading for a majority in parliament, along with his nationalist MHP ally, according to unconfirmed results quoted by state news agency Anadolu. His supporters ridiculed the opposition allies first for declaring that Mr Kilicdaroglu would become the 13th Turkish president, and then for gradually lowering their expectations as the night progressed. What this result does confirm is the extent to which Turkish society has become polarised, 100 years since Kemal Ataturk's foundation of the modern Turkish republic. In the final hours before voting began, Mr Kilicdaroglu rounded his campaign off with a trip to Ataturk's mausoleum in Ankara. President Erdogan instead chose to make a very symbolic statement to his conservative and nationalist support base, by making a campaign speech at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Ataturk had turned the former Orthodox Cathedral into a museum, but in 2020 Mr Erdogan made it a mosque. It is unclear how close the expected run-off will be, and there is already considerable speculation over what will happen to the 5% of votes that went to the third candidate in the election, ultranationalist Sinan Ogan. He knows both leaders will be trying to court him and is bound to set some tough conditions. It is far from certain that even if he does endorse either candidate the first-round voters he attracted will do the same.",

      "title": "Turkey decides on future with or without Erdogan",
      "text": "Turks are voting in the most pivotal elections in their modern history, to decide if Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains president after 20 years in power. His main rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, promises to scrap many of the powers acquired by President Erdogan after he survived a failed coup in 2016. Buoyed by a broad opposition alliance, he has a real chance of winning. But this race has become so intense and the stakes so high that campaigning went up to the wire. President Erdogan was filmed stretching election rules by addressing worshippers at Saturday evening prayers in Istanbul. To secure outright victory on Sunday, the winner needs more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise it goes to a run-off in two weeks' time. Turkey's 64 million voters go to the polls in particularly hard times. Rampant inflation is officially almost 44%, but many Turks believe it is far higher, while 11 of the country's provinces have been affected by twin earthquakes that left more than 50,000 people dead. At an optician's in Ankara, Burak Onder complained that hardly anyone was buying glasses any more: \"People don't even ask for discounts, they can't afford it.\" Inflation soared as President Erdogan abandoned orthodox economics, cutting interest rates while most other countries raised theirs. A few doors down the street, shopkeeper Rahime revealed layers of price labels that she stuck on top of each other almost daily because of soaring costs. \"People come in and ask why are prices rising all the time, and they leave without buying anything,\" she said. Rahime's 19-year-old daughter Sudenur feels anxious about the future, and is worried she may not be able to fulfil her ambition of studying sport science. As a first-time voter, she and five million other Turks like her are expected to make a big difference to the election result. Turks have from 08:00 to 17:00 (05:00-14:00 GMT) to vote, although 1.76 million have already cast their ballots abroad in Germany, France and other countries - a record 53% turnout. For survivors affected by the 6 February earthquakes, voting will prove far harder, because many have left their homes and can only vote where they are registered. The aftermath of the disaster has overshadowed the election campaign and become second only to the economy as a key issue. In Adana, where hundreds of people died in collapsed buildings, there is still palpable anger about the response. \"I think the earthquake will affect the outcome of the elections seriously, because people feel resentful to the government, if not the state,\" said Ezgi Karaher as she walked with her young daughter in the park. Political parties have laid on buses for thousands of survivors from across Turkey to travel back to vote in some of the worst-hit provinces where they are still registered. On the sunny platform at Iskenderun station, people were arriving by train too. \"It was standing-room only this morning,\" said one arrival on an early morning service. Staff said some 300 extra passengers were aboard, heading to stay with family or friends for the night. They were braced for even more voters to come in on the late train. Not everyone is able to go back. Two women at an Ankara supermarket told the BBC they would miss out on voting because they were having medical treatment following the earthquake. Party strongholds across the country are ablaze with their respective party colours and slogans. And tensions have increased in the run-up to polling day. Opposition parties are deploying volunteers to ensure the 192,000 ballot boxes and results are properly scrutinised to avoid the risk of fraud. One of the four presidential candidates, Muharrem Ince, pulled out of the race three days ago, citing a smear campaign of \"character assassination\". But it was too late to remove his name from the ballot. In the final hours of the campaign on Saturday, Mr Kilicdaroglu, 74, laid carnations at the mausoleum of Turkey's modern-day secular founder Ataturk. And President Erdogan, who is 69, ended his election push by leading evening prayers at Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, but then he went further. Video shared on social media showed him telling worshippers the Muslim world was closely following events in Turkey. His choice of venue and his decision to give a political speech after campaigning had officially ended was controversial, and highly symbolic to his supporters. Hagia Sophia, originally built as an Orthodox Christian cathedral, was a mosque under the Ottomans. But Ataturk turned it into a museum and it was President Erdogan who defied secular Turkey's founder and made it a mosque once more in 2020. Ultra-nationalist Sinan Ogan is the only other presidential candidate. But Turks are also voting for parliament and its 600 MPs. Although they have lost powers to Mr Erdogan's executive presidency since 2018, control of parliament remains key for passing legislation. Under Turkey's proportional voting system, parties form alliances so they can reach the 7% threshold required to enter parliament. The president's AK Party, which has Islamist roots, is part of the People's Alliance with the nationalist MHP and two other parties, while Mr Kilicdaroglu's centre-left Republican People's Party is working with the nationalist Good Party and four smaller parties under the Nation Alliance. The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkey's second biggest opposition party, is part of another alliance, but has campaigned under a different name, the Green Left.",

His main rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu appeared before a throng of supporters on Friday, flanked by allies from across the political spectrum who have come together as never before. As the rain beat down in Ankara, he vowed to restore \"peace and democracy\". The man he wants voters to oust after 20 years - Recep Tayyip Erdogan - said he had kept Turkey standing tall despite many challenges, including the economy with its rampant inflation and February's catastrophic double earthquakes. Both have dominated this febrile campaign for both the presidency and parliament. At 74, the opposition leader is often described as soft-spoken, but he gave a powerful speech to an audience that believes this is their best hope so far of reclaiming power from a president who has taken it away from parliament and increased his own dramatically. Mr Kilicdaroglu is slightly ahead in the opinion polls and his supporters have dared to dream he might win the vote outright on Sunday, with more than 50% of the vote, rather than face a run-off two weeks later. Firat, one of five million first-time voters, said he was delighted at conservatives and nationalists appearing on the same platform as the head of the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP). Here was nationalist Meral Aksener, the only female leader in the six-strong alliance, and there was Temel Karamollaoglu, who fronts the pro-Islamist Felicity party. Mr Kilicdaroglu's party is secular to the core, but he has worked hard to reach out to women who wear the headscarf. The six parties have rallied under the slogan Haydi (Come on!) and a campaign song of the same name. Tensions are running so high ahead of the vote that he wore a bullet-proof vest on stage in Ankara and at another event earlier on. The race has become as tense as it is pivotal. One of the four candidates for the presidency, Muharrem Ince, pulled out on Thursday, complaining that he had been targeted on social media with deepfake sex videos that had \"manipulated the electorate\". When the main opposition challenger blamed Russia, the Kremlin denied having anything to do with the videos or seeking to interfere in the vote. Mr Erdogan, who has maintained ties with Vladimir Putin, warned his rival: \"If you attack Putin, I will not be ok with that.\" The president was addressing party loyalists in Istanbul, but the night before he was just outside the capital in a city of half a million people that seemed in full support of his AK Party. Orange, blue and white party AKP flags fluttered throughout the centre of Sincan, as locals filled the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of Mr Erdogan. Supporters chanted party songs as they waited for the president to show on stage in a green jacket. One chorus rang out repeatedly Re-cep Tay-yip Er-do-gaaaan. \"We built schools, universities and hospitals... we changed the face of our cities. We extracted our own natural gas and oil,\" Erdogan told thousands of cheering supporters. His strategy, first as prime minister but then as president, has been to build growth, often through big-ticket construction projects that are visible in many of the big cities, but not so obvious in Sincan. Although his party still commands strong support, he relies on the backing of the nationalist MHP and other smaller groups in his People's Alliance. His greatest support comes mainly from conservative or nationalist Turks, and he has aimed his rhetoric not just at the West, which he accuses of going against him, but at the LGBT community too. \"The AK Party does not allow LGBT people into its neighbourhood, and the MHP does not allow them into the People's Alliance, because we believe in the sanctity of a family.\" These political alliances have become essential under Turkey's political system as a party needs 7% of the national vote to get into parliament, or be part of an alliance that does. Whoever wins the presidency will need to have sufficient support in parliament to back their plans. On the campaign trail in Ankara, centre-left candidate Aysun Palali Koktas said that while the economy and the aftermath of the earthquake were the top two issues of the election, the future of Turkey's democracy and people's rights were just as important. \"When we tweet, we don't want to be frightened, and that's the case especially for young people,\" she said. But, AK Party candidate Zehranur Aydemir, 25, believes young voters are very well treated by the government. \"You can see young people at every level in our party.\" More than 64 million people are expected vote at home and abroad on Sunday. To win outright a candidate will have to secure more than half the vote. If no candidate gets at least 50% plus one vote in the first round, the presidential election will go to a second round on 28 May between the two who received the most votes.",

      "title": "Gary Lineker on the J-League: 'It began with an earthquake and a 5-0 loss. And then things got worse' - BBC Sport",
      "text": "The day of my J-League debut for Nagoya Grampus Eight began with an earthquake where our whole hotel shook… and then we lost 5-0 and I didn't get a kick. It was not exactly a dream start. It was half a lifetime ago for me now, but going there felt like a big adventure - it was the launch of football as a professional sport in that country and to be involved in something new like that is unusual for any player, especially somewhere that did things so differently. I just wish I'd been able to play more, although there was absolutely nothing I could do about that. It was exciting to be there right at the start and see it take off the way it did, but it was also where my career ended, and not in the way I wanted it to. The first I heard about any interest from Japan was in March 1991 when Grampus Eight faxed my agent and my club, Tottenham, about the possibility of signing me, but nothing really progressed until June, when I went to Tokyo with Spurs to play in a friendly. That was the start of discussions which led to me being offered a two-year contract to come and play in the new J-League, which was replacing an amateur league made up of corporate teams - Grampus Eight were formerly known as Toyota Motors, and were still being bankrolled by them. The opportunity came at the right time because I was already thinking a lot about my future. I was almost 31 and had always wanted to go out of English football at the top, so I was planning to retire when my Spurs contract finished in 1993. Then the Japanese came in and we thought: \"Well, this is something completely different.\" Obviously it was a big pay-day but I'd always been interested in travelling and experiencing other cultures after playing in Barcelona and this seemed like a really nice way to end my career, in a country that had always fascinated me and would also be safe for my family. I didn't want to just go gradually downhill in England, which I already felt like I was on the brink of doing because I knew my powers were waning, so it appealed for footballing reasons too. I thought I could go out there and still score a few goals and it all will be really positive. That was the plan, and the only thing that went wrong with it was when I got injured - although the news we got about my baby son George later that year meant we almost didn't go to Japan at all. Sometimes things happen very quickly in football, and in life. In November 1991, I scored the goal against Poland that sent England to Euro 92 and then said I would be retiring from international football after that tournament. The following week, Tottenham announced I would be leaving them in the summer of 1992 as well. I was getting my wish to bow out of English football at the top and was moving to Japan for a transfer fee of just under £1m, in time for the start of the J-League's launch season in May 1993. It was all official, and very exciting. Then, only a few days later, everything changed. We were told that George, who was just a few weeks old, had acute myeloid leukaemia. He'd had a problem with a few lumps and at first the doctors thought it was a skin complaint. In fact he was seriously ill with an extremely rare condition and did not leave Great Ormond Street Hospital for the next seven months. Football, and everything else, was suddenly on hold, and it was a massively tough period for myself and my wife Michelle. George needed five solid courses of chemotherapy and a couple of times we were told that he wouldn't make it through the night. We didn't even think about Japan for a long time. George was the only thing that mattered and, eventually, he began responding well to his treatment. When it got to the end of the 1991-92 season and I said goodbye to Spurs, and to English football, George went into remission at around the same time. We had another eight months or so after that before the J-League started and it was during that period that he came home, but it was only probably at the beginning of 1993 that we were absolutely sure we would be able to go to Japan. People often say prematurely that, when someone has finished their treatment for leukaemia, they are cured, but that's not the case - being in remission is very different. As the medics will tell you, you are not cured until you reach five years, post-treatment, without a relapse. So, when we moved to Japan, George had to have tests every two or three weeks to make sure his blood count was where it should be. It was still a very concerning time but we knew the way they treat leukaemia is the same globally, and that his treatment over there would be first class. We were very lucky in that he stayed in good health and made a full recovery. Still, I know that if George had been ill a bit earlier, when we were making the decision about going to Japan, we wouldn't have gone. Equally, if he'd fallen ill six months later, in that period where we were just about to go, then we wouldn't have left the UK either. But the fact we had this cushion of a few months, post-treatment, meant we had a chance to see how he got on. It gave me time to learn the language too, or at least try to pick up enough Japanese to get by. When we arrived in Nagoya, which is around 160 miles south-west of Tokyo, in March 1993, I could tell a taxi where to go, or ring up and book a table in a restaurant and order a meal - but I couldn't sit down and have a proper conversation with someone. I'd found understanding it far more difficult than Spanish had been. That didn't really affect things football-wise, because there were always translators around the team. Otherwise it would have been tricky, but what tends to happen in language anyway is that you learn most of the words you need for your particular walk of life, whatever job you are doing, so I picked up all the footballing terms very quickly. A lot of them were quite anglicised anyway - offside is ofusaido, good save is naisukipa and good shot is naisushotto. You heard that last one all the time and it used to make me chuckle sometimes, because hearing it spoken in a Japanese manner was quite amusing. There were a few players at Grampus Eight who spoke excellent English too, like our Dutch keeper Dido Havenaar, who was a lovely guy and became a good friend. But, apart from a few Brazilians, there were not many other foreign players at any of the teams. That was because the Japanese had learned from what happened in the United States and Canada the first time they tried to launch a professional league in the 1970s, when the North American Soccer League was overwhelmed by imported stars and only lasted a few years before folding. Instead, Japan only picked a few big-name players - myself, Brazil legend Zico and Germany's World Cup-winning midfielder Pierre Littbarski - to sign up and publicise it, which was very sensible. Planning everything meticulously is seen as a Japanese trait, and they did that with everything around the J-League too. They started off fairly small, with only 10 teams in that first season, but the model for marketing and fan engagement was based on established American sports like baseball and American football. They did all of that in a big way because they knew if football was going to catch on then it had to be as entertaining as possible. So, the emphasis was on fun, with face-paint, huge flags, fireworks and loud music before games plus stacks of merchandise and team mascots - we had Grampus-kun the dolphin, one of the symbols of the city of Nagoya that the team was named after. It was all very noisy and colourful and nothing like anything I'd seen before, and the way the fans behaved was really refreshing too. Everyone was always extremely excited but they were all respectful and positive, and there was none of the abuse you might get as a player at an away ground in England. Instead, the atmosphere was more like going to an England schoolboy international, with mainly young people in the crowd, lots of female fans - which was great to see - and screaming. Lots and lots of screaming. The screaming didn't just happen at games, either. In fact, we were mobbed everywhere we went. It was crazy, really. I always signed as many autographs as I could when I was a player anyway but there was much more demand in Japan. Again, they were well prepared. I remember the fans always carried white boards for you to sign your name on, and they always had a marker pen too. The way they were marketing the J-League meant I also did lots of Japanese TV commercials, which were fun. Whether they were for cars, banks, soft drinks or anything else, I think every single advert I did involved an overhead kick, which they seemed to be obsessed with at the time. I suspect it's moved on a bit since then, but there are probably a few Japanese people who grew up wrongly thinking that was my signature finish. Everywhere you went, the game was booming and the level of interest was incredible, especially when you consider how tiny it had been in Japan even just before the J-League started. Baseball was the big thing, but football was also behind rugby and all sorts of their own sports, like sumo wrestling, in terms of popularity. Their mission had been to change that and, because it was a completely new sport, they were able to innovate to cater for their target audience, which was people under 30. For example, they introduced sudden-death extra time and penalty shootouts to decide J-League matches. Draws are part of our game, so for me that part was a bit strange, but I understand why they did it and, overall, everything they tried seemed to work. Every game was completely sold out, including our first one, which was away at Zico's team, Kashima Antlers. We weren't a very good side, which became more and more apparent as the season went on, but that was probably the worst game I played in and it was certainly the most one-sided. Zico had just turned 40 but he was absolutely unbelievable that day, with a brilliant hat-trick including a superb free-kick into the top corner. They absolutely hammered us and I don't think I got a single chance in front of goal, which was annoying to say the least. That lack of service continued to be a problem and I only scored one goal in my first six games, but far worse was to come. I had gone there to promote the league as much as to play in it, which was just as well considering what happened. I'd first injured the big toe on my right foot playing for Spurs halfway through my final season in England. It was towards the end of the second leg of a European tie, we were comfortably ahead on aggregate and I'd been playing a lot of games for club and country so I'd asked Peter Shreeves to take me off for a rest. He kept saying \"give me two more minutes\" and that turned into five minutes, and then 10. A ball was played through and I thought I could just nick it ahead of the keeper, and I did… but, as I slid out, his foot came through and crushed my toe. I played for the rest of that season, in constant agony I have to say, and on pain killers to get me through it. Then I had an operation in the October before I headed out to Japan. It didn't improve things much but I was able to trundle along in training and get through matches - I played the first few games of the J-League season. But I was starting to get shooting pain in the toe next to it, which felt weird. I mentioned it to the club doctors and they did some X-rays but they said they couldn't see anything. They just said it might be a damaged tendon or something, and that they would give me a little injection to play. So, for the next game I had a pain-killing injection in it and I was fine for about 40 minutes or so but then my entire right foot just kind of went into spasm. There was no pain but it clenched up, like a claw. It was the weirdest sensation I'd ever had but I made it through to half-time and I was sitting in the dressing room thinking: \"What the hell is this about?\" It didn't take long to find out. Just before we went out for the second half it started to hurt, when I got on to the pitch there was more pain and then pretty quickly I was in absolute hellish agony and I had to come off, on 46 minutes. I went to the hospital for some more X-rays and it turned out the toe that they had just injected had actually snapped; it was completely broken and the bone had to be screwed back together. The next day or so, I went back to the club doctor and asked if they still had the X-rays they had taken the previous week, because I was sure I'd seen something then but had thought to myself: \"What do I know? I'm not a doctor.\" I looked at the X-ray and said: \"Do you see that? What do you think that is?\" He went \"ah yes, maybe this is a stress fracture\" and I went \"oh my god\". I should never have played with that. I was out for three or four months and, as soon as I came back, the old injury - my big toe - started hurting really badly, more than it had been, because the other toe next to it, the one that snapped, had healed in a weird way. It meant I couldn't play at all, and I was given the option of stopping there and then or trying another operation, this time in the United States, to reconstruct it, then eight months of recovery to play the final few weeks of my contract. I went for the latter. I was loving my life in Japan and I thought I wasn't quite finished as a player yet. I've always felt I had let Grampus Eight down when I couldn't get myself on the pitch, even though I couldn't do anything about my injury, but I will always be grateful for how incredibly patient and understanding, and supportive the club were. That period of my career was incredibly frustrating but there were positives too, because it helped me move on and accept my time as a player was over. The fact that I was constantly in rehabilitation for so much of my two years in Japan gave me the urge to start a new life. It wasn't like I just stepped away from football one day, like some players do, and it ended like that, very suddenly. Instead, it was gradual and by the time I did finish and come home, at the end of 1994, I was desperate to do something different. I'd already begun my media career by working for the BBC at the World Cup earlier that year, so I knew what was coming next. A few people in England had asked me to give it another go as a player, including my old England team-mate Bryan Robson, who had just taken charge at Middlesbrough in what is now the Championship, but I just had to hold my hands up and tell them: 'I can't play.' There was just no way I could have competed in the Premier League or even the second tier here. My big toe had been screwed together and the joint had fused solidly, and I was still getting used to that. I can walk and run absolutely fine now, but at the time it still felt very odd and running wasn't easy. I could not get off the mark very quickly at all so I had lost that yard of pace that was essential to my game. I would not have been very good, and I did not want to carry on if that was the case. I did manage to play a few times more for Grampus, including one final appearance right at the end of my second season but by then I could hardly move, even with the help of more pain-killing injections. They gave me a lovely send off, turning all the lights off in the stadium at the final whistle and putting a spotlight on me on the pitch before I got a standing ovation. I couldn't play the 90 minutes, sadly, but it was still a special moment because it is probably the only game that my kids ever saw me play - well, two of them anyway - not that they will have any memory of it. George was two by then and Harry just a few months old. Because it was my final game in Japan, Michelle had brought them both along and that turned out to be my last game full stop. I kicked a ball around with my sons when they were growing up but I've not played another game since, not even five-a-side or anything, ever. When it started, there was a risk that it would just be a fad but when I look at Japanese football now, I see a success story that began 30 years ago and continues to grow to this day. The J-League has expanded so it now has 28 teams in two divisions and continues to be hugely popular with fans, but the game there has progressed in many other ways too. Their players were technically sound when I was there, and always worked very hard, but they had only just turned professional so you could understand why they were maybe a little fragile mentally, and lacked the tactical awareness or toughness you saw in more established leagues. That is certainly not the case now. Their top players are in demand, globally, playing at clubs all over the world and helping the international team make a real impact as well. Japan co-hosted the 2002 men's World Cup, which was another of their aims when they started out, and the men's national team has played at all seven finals since 1998, after failing to qualify once before then. Their women's side is currently the leading side in Asia too. I played no part in any of that success but it is great to see because I still have a real affinity with the country and its culture, and so do my family. Harry was born there and we still call him Harry chan now, which is a Japanese term of endearment. He is very proud of his connection with Japan and it means a lot to him - when Leicester won the Premier League in 2016 his favourite player was Shinji Okazaki and he wore his shirt every time he watched a match. Our neighbours in the little apartment where we lived in Nagoya had ended up becoming his godparents, and last year he went back to visit them, and go back to his roots. My favourite memory of my time in Japan has to be the day he was born, which is quite a story. It was about two weeks before Michelle was due and her mother had come out early to stay with us. I had just finished playing golf and someone at the club told me I had a call. It was Michelle and she said she thought she'd started having contractions. I said: \"Right, I'll come straight home,\" but she said: \"No, no, you know it will take ages so don't rush.\" So I had a bite to eat before heading home but when I got there, Michelle wasn't there, just her mum, with George. She said: \"She's had to go, it's all happened very quickly.\" I thought \"oh no\" and jumped in the car - it was about a 40-minute drive to the hospital and I thought I might have missed everything. When I got there I was about to run inside when two nurses saw me and said: \"Lineker-san, Lineker-san, sutoppu, sutoppu!\" - telling me I had to stop. I was like, \"why sutoppu!?!\" and they said: \"Shoes!\" I went \"shoes?\", and they said, \"change shoes, put on slippers,\" so I rushed to put these slippers on and they were always too small in Japan, so I was awkwardly shuffling along while still moving as quickly as possible. I made it to the maternity unit and there was a big glass door. I could hear Michelle behind it, screaming in agony in labour, so I went to go straight through… and some more nurses shouted \"Lineker-san, sutoppu, sutoppu!\" Again I asked: \"Sutoppu? Why sutoppu now?\" and they said: \"Slippers.\" I said: \"I've got slippers!\" and they said: \"No, change slippers. Different slippers.\" Anyway I threw them on and dashed in and saw Michelle there and, less than 20 seconds later, the baby came out. As a striker, you always have to time your run, you see, and I guess you never really lose it. I didn't do it very often in Japan, but I still managed it when it really mattered. Gary Lineker was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

      "title": "Muharrem Ince: Turkish candidate dramatically pulls out before election",
      "text": "Three days before Turkey's tightest presidential vote in years, one of the four candidates, Muharrem Ince, has pulled out of the race. Mr Ince had been under increasing pressure for splitting the opposition vote, when they have their biggest chance yet of removing Recep Tayyip Erdogan from power. \"I'm withdrawing my candidacy,\" he told reporters. He cited fake sex pictures as one of his reasons for pulling out. He complained that for 45 days he had been slandered and suffered character assassination, and Turkish authorities had failed to protect his reputation. \"Fake invoices, fake videos, pictures… they took a video from an Israeli porn website and added my face there,\" he said. \"Unfortunately some people in Turkey shared those for the sake of being in so-called opposition.\" But he also said he did not want to be blamed by the alliance of opposition parties if they lost the presidential vote. Mr Ince's decision to pull out gives President Erdogan's biggest rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, a big boost, and Turkey's main stock market soared on the news. Mr Erdogan has led his country for more than 20 years, but Turkey is grappling with an inflation rate of 44%. The has also been criticised for failings in the response to a double earthquake in February that killed more than 50,000 people in 11 provinces. Mr Kilicdaroglu, a soft-spoken man of 74, heads an alliance of six opposition parties and latest polls give him 49% of the vote. Although Mr Ince is polling only a small share of the vote, opposition supporters hope his withdrawal might be enough to tip Mr Kilicdaroglu over the 50% needed to win the election outright on Sunday. If no candidate secures 50%, the vote goes to a run-off two weeks later. Mr Ince, 59, won 30% of the vote for the main opposition Republican People's party five years ago, but he left the party the following year.",

      "text": "A body has been found in New Zealand caves where a teenager went missing during a school trip on Tuesday. He was among a group of 17 who went to the Abbey Caves despite widespread flooding in the Auckland region. The group was initially trapped but 14 students and two teachers made it out safely. The boy, aged between 15 and 16, was unaccounted for. New Zealand police said the body was recovered late on Tuesday local time, but has not been formally identified. Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, has declared a state of emergency after heavy rainfall stranded cars, uprooted trees and disrupted public transport. But most roads that were earlier closed reopened on Wednesday and public transport was operating. The Abbey Caves, a series of three underground caves on the upper North Island, features limestone outcrops and sink holes. The cave system is prone to flash flooding. The caves remained behind a police cordon on Wednesday, even as well-wishers left flowers there. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has weighed in, telling the New Zealand Herald that it is \"every parent's worst possible nightmare\" not to have their child return home from school. Police Superintendent Tony Hill also acknowledged that the public will want answers on the \"very distressing\" event. The incident has raised questions about why the school trip went ahead even after weather forecasts warned of heavy rains. The group is from Whangārei Boys' High School. In a post on the school's Facebook page on Wednesday, principal Karen Gilbert-Smith wrote: \"It is really important for me to let you know how devastated we are that one of our whānau [family] have lost a much loved, and treasured, son and brother.\" \"The impact of this tragedy is being felt widely amongst our school staff, students and community.\" The Auckland region in New Zealand has been hit by several extreme weather events thus far this year. From January to April, it received 90% of its average total annual rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 35mm (1.3in) of rain in just one hour. In February, Cyclone Gabrielle ravaged New Zealand, leaving 11 people dead and a trail of devastation that Finance Minister Grant Robertson likened to the damage wrought by the Christchurch earthquake from 12 years ago.",

      "title": "Turkey elections: Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu offer stark choices for presidency",
      "text": "Turks are at a historic turning point - choosing between two front-runners for the presidency offering dramatically different paths for their country's future. After more than 20 years in power, Recep Tayyip Erdogan promises a strong, multilateral Turkey and the creation of six million jobs, and accuses the West of trying to bring him down. His chief rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition, wants to steer this Nato member state back towards a pro-Western, more democratic stance. The president accuses his opponents of being \"pro-LGBT\", while his Islamist-rooted party positions itself as on the side of the family. Since 2017, Mr Erdogan has run Turkey with sweeping presidential powers, from a vast palace in Ankara. As executive president he can declare a state of emergency and can pick or dismiss civil servants. If he wins, not much will change, says Selim Koru, a member of Turkey's Tepav think tank. His powers are already so broad he won't seek to extend them further, he says. But the man seeking to replace him wants to scrap the presidential system and become an \"impartial\" leader, with no connection to a political party. Mr Kilicdaroglu says he would roll Turkey back to having parliament and a prime minister in charge, and revive independent courts and a free press. \"I will serve all 85 million citizens of Turkey. I will show respect for each of you,\" he has promised. The other five parties in his alliance would each have a vice president, as would his party colleagues who are mayors of Ankara and Istanbul. Before they do scrap the powerful presidency, they might need to use its powers to force through the reforms if they do not have sufficient control of parliament. Parliamentary and presidential elections will both be taking place on 14 May. Turkey is part of the West's Nato defensive alliance, but the Erdogan presidency has sought close ties with China and Russia too, buying a Russian S-400 air defence system and inaugurating a Russian-built nuclear plant - Turkey's first - ahead of the election. He advocates a multilateral stance, viewing Turkey as \"an island of peace and security\", and offering Ankara as a mediator in the Russian war in Ukraine. His opponent and his allies, meanwhile, want to return to the process of joining the European Union and restore Turkey's military ties with the US, while maintaining relations with Russia. If Mr Erdogan stays in power then Selim Koru believes he will continue to push Turkey away from the West, without leaving Nato. \"He wants to get Turkey to a point in the medium term or distant future where Nato membership is irrelevant.\" This is a crunch moment for Turkey's economy too. Inflation is officially 43.68%, and Turks have had a cost of living crisis far more severe than most. Many will tell you the real inflation rate feels far higher. The early Erdogan years were a byword for strong economic growth and enormous construction projects. And Turkey always stuck closely to the terms of its loan agreements with the IMF. But in recent years his government has abandoned orthodox economic policy. It gradually eroded the independence of the central bank, says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University, sacking three of its governors in quick succession. Inflation soared, as interest rates were kept low - while Turkey's currency the lira depreciated to improve the trade balance and boost exports. Mr Erdogan still promises high growth, six million new jobs and a big push for tourism, but Prof Demiralp believes his policies will keep inflation as high as 45% for months to come. If Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his allies win the presidency and parliament, she believes a return to orthodox economic policies and an independent central bank will lower inflation to 30% by the end of 2023 and it will continue to go down after that. Even if it means higher interest rates, Prof Demiralp believes Turkey could enjoy strong growth from foreign investment: \"At the moment Turkey is rather cheap and its location, young population and the infrastructure offer mutually beneficial investment opportunities for international investors.\" This election is being watched very carefully by 3.5 million Syrian refugees who have temporary protection in Turkey, as the opposition challenger wants to send them home \"within two years at the latest\". That's a major worry for Syrians, who came here mainly in the first six years of the war until 2017. More than than 80% of Turks want them to go home, and after the economy and the aftermath of the earthquake it is the most important issue for Turks, says Prof Murat Erdogan, who conducts a regular Syrians Barometer. And yet more than 700,000 Syrians are in Turkish schools and 880,000 Syrian babies have been born in Turkey since 2011. \"I cannot understand how they would leave this life and go back to Syria,\" says Prof Erdogan. Kemal Kilicdaroglu says he will negotiate the Syrians' return with Damascus, but as Syria insists on Turkey leaving its 30km (18-mile) buffer zone over the border, that runs the risk of Syria launching attacks on the zone and sparking a new wave of refugees. The opposition leader knows full well an agreement would take up to two years, and he would ask the United Nations to oversee it. But argues Murat Erdogan believes it could take a decade to implement. President Erdogan has sought to defuse the issue, by promising to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians through an agreement with President Bashar al-Assad. But the idea of Syrians returning voluntarily seems far-fetched. There is a lot at stake in this election for Turkey's Kurds, who make up as much as a fifth of Turkey's 85 million people. Up to one in 10 voters back the pro-Kurdish HDP, who are the second biggest opposition party. They have publicly backed Kemal Kilicdaroglu for president and see the vote as \"the most crucial elections in Turkey's history\". Kurdish voters initially backed the Erdogan government's policies as their rights were improved in the first decade of his rule. But that turned sour in 2015, when peace talks broke down on ending a decades-long insurgency by the Kurdish militant PKK, seen by Turkey and its Western allies as a terrorist group. President Erdogan accuses Mr Kilicdaroglu of surrendering to the \"blackmail\" and agenda of the HDP and militants. \"My nation will not hand this country over to a president who got support from Qandil,\" he warned, raising the stakes still higher by referring to the militants' headquarters in northern Iraq. The opposition challenger has openly courted Turkey's Kurdish population, millions of whom he says are \"treated as terrorists on a daily basis\" and are stigmatised by a government looking for the nationalist vote. The pro-Kurdish party vehemently denies government allegations of being a \"political wing\" for the militants. It is standing under an umbrella Green Left movement in case the government seeks to bar its candidates.",

      "title": "UKIP on brink of wipeout after losing all seats in local elections",
      "text": "In 2014, David Cameron was still British prime minister and \"Brexit\" was an obscure word. In that year's elections to the European Parliament, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) triggered what its then-leader Nigel Farage called \"an earthquake in British politics\". UKIP clinched 24 seats and 27% of the popular vote, marking the first time a party other than the Conservatives or Labour had won a UK national election for a century. The result gave UKIP the momentum to push for a vote on the UK's membership of the European Union and campaign successfully for leaving. Now, eight years on, the disruptor of British politics is staring down the barrel of electoral annihilation. Following local elections across England last week, UKIP lost all its remaining district and county councillors. To put that into context, the party has gone from almost 500 of those councillors in 2016 - its high watermark - to zero in 2023. \"It's no exaggeration to talk about a wipeout,\" said Tim Bale, a professor of politics and author of The Conservative Party after Brexit. All that remains for UKIP are elected holdouts on parish and town councils, the lowest tier of local government. The party's chairman, Ben Walker, said UKIP still has about 30 parish councillors, himself among them, after last week's local elections. \"It certainly wasn't a disaster based on what we thought we'd get from these elections,\" he told the BBC. Even so, the results overall show how far the party has fallen from the heights of 2014. The BBC's results say, in total, UKIP lost 25 seats, which were last up for election in 2019. Mr Walker said only one incumbent UKIP councillor - Steve Hollis in South Staffordshire - contested these elections for the party. He lost, while the party's only other sitting councillor retired. Little by little, UKIP councillors have either defected to other parties or quit since 2019. The political fortunes of UKIP, originally a single-issue Eurosceptic party, have declined sharply since Mr Farage stood down as its leader in 2016. Brexit was Mr Farage's crowing glory as leader, but since then, UKIP has been unsure of its place in the British political landscape and burned through six leaders, as it attempts to find a new purpose in a post-Brexit world. Prof Bale said, although UKIP struck a chord with many voters who were hostile to the EU and didn't believe the Conservative government was doing enough to limit immigration, the party was \"ultimately a vehicle for the political ambitions of one man - Nigel Farage\". \"Once he abandoned them, they were always likely to fade away and die,\" Prof Bale said. Internal instability and infighting has not helped UKIP's cause, with Mr Farage himself criticising the party's drift towards a far-right, anti-Islam platform under former leader Gerard Batten. \"The problem we've had is a succession of failed leaders and misdirection,\" Mr Walker said. \"People look at us and think, well, you've kind of did what you meant to do, didn't you? We're out of Europe, your job's done. That's where we're at. So we're trying to redefine what we are now, which is no easy task.\" Under the current leadership of Neil Hamilton, a former Conservative MP, UKIP has been calling itself the \"only truly patriotic political party\" and promoting policies such as ending mass migration and scrapping most foreign aid. That's similar territory to Reform UK, which was founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, and which campaigned to leave the EU without a deal. As Reform UK, the party has failed to make a big impression on the electorate recently, winning just six seats in last week's local elections. The party, led by Richard Tice, had fielded hundreds of candidates, mainly in areas that had voted heavily to leave the EU in 2016. Mr Walker said pooling resources with Reform UK and other like-minded smaller parties on the right was one route to an electoral revival for UKIP. But Dr David Jeffery, a senior lecturer in British Politics at the University of Liverpool, said there appeared to be no way back for populist parties on the right of politics. \"Even Reform, the party to the right of the Conservatives with the most funding and media attention, without the galvanising issue of EU membership struggles to break past 6% in the polls,\" he said. \"The party is over for UKIP.\" Many of those who voted for UKIP in the mid-2010s haven't gone away though. Instead, many of them switched to the Conservatives after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to \"get Brexit done\". \"We are now one of the only Western democracies to not have a successful populist party,\" said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and the author of a book about UKIP's rise. \"Much of this reflects how the Conservatives repositioned after Brexit to attract Nigel Farage's voters, though whether they can keep this force at bay, with rising immigration and a spiralling cost-of-living crisis, remains to be seen.\"",

      "title": "New Zealand: Auckland declares flood emergency as student goes missing in cave",
      "text": "New Zealand's capital Auckland has declared a state of emergency after torrential rain caused widespread flooding. Rescuers are also searching for a high school student missing in a flooded cave north of the city. Heavy rainfall on Tuesday filled basements, stranded cars, toppled trees and disrupted rail services. The same area was hit by record rainfall in January, and Cyclone Gabrielle a month later. The torrential rains are expected to last until Wednesday evening local time. A state of emergency was declared as a precaution and disaster response services have been mobilised, Auckland Deputy Mayor Desley Simpson told reporters. She described the flooding as an \"evolving emergency situation\". Rescue teams were dispatched to Abbey Caves, about 2.5 hours drive north of Auckland, in search of the missing student, whose classmates made it out of the flood-prone cave safely. \"Our thoughts are with the whanau (family) of the missing child, as well as all those involved in the group outing and the school,\" police Superintendent Tony Hill said. From January to April, the Auckland region received 90% of its average total annual rainfall, the New Zealand Meteorological Service's Georgina Griffiths said, with some areas receiving up to 35mm (1.3in) of rain in just one hour. \"The region is very saturated after a very rough five months. We're pretty soggy,\" she told reporters. Authorities advised people to postpone unnecessary travel and avoid driving on flooded streets. Images on local media showed people rushing out of office buildings to go home early, causing traffic jams in some parts of the city. Cyclone Gabrielle ravaged New Zealand in mid-February, leaving 11 people dead and a trail of devastation that Finance Minister Grant Robertson likened to the damage wrought by the Christchurch earthquake from 12 years ago. The cyclone hit just weeks after torrential rains and flooding left four dead and parts of Auckland's main airport submerged.",

      "title": "Turkey elections: Aftershocks of anger and grief in the quake-hit nation",
      "text": "There is no election fever in the ancient city of Antakya in southern Turkey - just rubble and torment. \"What I want from the ballot box is his dead body and nothing else,\" says Fethiye Keklik. \"Our souls have been ripped away. He's no use to us.\" The 68-year-old grandmother is referring to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Insulting the president can get you jailed here, but she won't be silenced. \"He just brings harm. I'm thinking of burning my ballot paper - in front of the police and the soldiers.\" Turkey's Islamist leader is looking vulnerable as never before in upcoming elections for parliament and the presidency on 14 May. The end of the authoritarian Erdogan era - if it comes - should mean a freer, more democratic Turkey. Jails may be less crowded and relations with the West less fraught. In the run-up to the polls, Turks have had much to complain - and grieve - about, from the state's slow response to February's earthquakes to an economy in ruins. The official inflation rate is 50%. The real figure could be twice that. Experts blame the president's economic policies, politely described as \"unorthodox\". Here in southern Turkey, politics and economics are overshadowed by death. The official toll from the worst natural disaster in modern Turkish history is more than 50,000. Many here believe the real figure is much higher and the government has stopped counting. Fethiye's count is four. We find her at a bleak roadside cemetery where her grief rends the air. She is crumpled on the ground, in a dark headscarf and woollen cardigan, crying out to her son Coskun, 45, who lies beneath the soil. \"How can I forget you?\" she wails, clutching the crude wooden board marking his grave. \"Please take me with you. You left orphans behind you. I've brought Eren to see you.\" At the mention of his name, her four-year-old grandson comes to console her, squatting down by the grave to give her a hug. \"Your father is lying here,\" she tells him. \"No, Papa isn't here,\" says Eren firmly. The sombre little boy, in a dark blue anorak, has a raised scar on his forehead - imprinted by the quakes. Fethiye cradled him in her arms under the rubble for eight hours before they were pulled free - not by Turkish rescue workers, but by neighbours, who are Syrian refugees. The family lost Eren's father, brother, sister and a nephew - all four now lie buried in a row. Fethiye blames corrupt officials, cowboy builders and, most of all, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"In first place, it's him,\" she says, \"because he gave an opportunity to such people. The developers bribe the municipalities and they build. They bribe and build. They killed us all.\" The earthquakes exposed structural faults in President Erdogan's long rule. He presided over repeated amnesties for illegal construction. Developers could build a death trap and just pay a fine. And the state itself was hollowed out, critics say, resulting in a lack of proper oversight and preparedness. Walk through what remains of Antakya - a crucible of civilisations and religions - and you can see the consequences. Centuries of history have been reduced to a patchwork of ruins and empty spaces. Outside one collapsed house a chunky grey armchair remains intact, as if the owner might come back and take a seat. Some multi-storey blocks have been upended, others ripped open like grotesque dolls' houses. Almost every conversation here is punctuated with stories of the dead - many of whom perished waiting for help that never came. But in this deeply polarised country, the earthquakes are another fissure. Supporters of the president - and there are many - echo his view that it was destiny. Among his religious conservative support base, his leadership remains an article of faith. We come across Ibrahim Sener sitting in the ruins of Zumrut Street in Antakya's old city, among shards of glass and jagged metal. The 62-year-old seems not to notice, lost in thought and cigarette smoke. \"Our house cracked from end to end,\" he tells us. \"We lived the biggest nightmare inside the house. We can't be happy that we survived because we lost our family and friends. There were no phone lines, no internet. No-one could help anyone. After five or six hours I got the news that my brother had died.\" His belief in the president is unshaken. \"It came from God,\" he says. \"It was God's will that it happened. This should not be politicised. It's not our president who created the earthquake. Our president did his best.\" Ibrahim goes on his way, but two women remain just across the road - Gozde Burgac, 29, and her aunt Suheyla Kilic, 50, who are both actresses. Gozde has a tattoo on her arm - \"life is beautiful\" written in French. In this new landscape of rubble, it reads like a mockery. They came to the area to feed stray cats, an enduring Turkish tradition even in the worst of times. And they listened to Ibrahim's account in disbelief and in agony. \"What I've just heard really offended me because nobody helped us in any way,\" says Gozde, close to tears. \"Were we in a different universe, or was he? What he said about Erdogan was definitely not true. It's his fault. The government are the ones obliged to help us, but nobody was here. \"With our own efforts, our own means, we tried to reach our families during the first hours of the earthquake. We reached their dead bodies hours later, days later.\" Gozde says officials from the presidency showed up once, as her brother-in-law was about to be brought out alive. She says her brother-in-law was rescued by an Italian team, while all the government officials did was \"pose for the cameras, so their uniforms were visible\". \"Then they left and nobody else came,\" she says. The women are now in mourning for three relatives, and for the treasured mosaic that was their city. Will all the death and destruction shift the needle on election day? The answer may be no. Polls taken after the quakes suggested only a minor drop in support for the president, who has apologised for the state's sluggish response. He has also promised an ambitious - if implausible - reconstruction programme. \"It won't affect Erdogan,\" according to Istanbul-based political analyst and pollster Can Selcuki. \"This election is not about performance. It's about identity. Those who want him, want him no matter what.\" After more than two decades in power, the Turkish leader has a serious - if mild-mannered - challenger. Kemal Kilicdaroglu is the secular candidate of an opposition alliance. Opinion polls give a slight lead to Kilicdaroglu, who is famed for making election videos sitting at the table in his modest kitchen. In a BBC interview, the former civil servant promised to bring freedom and democracy, and to reorient Turkey towards the West. But many aren't writing off the president just yet. That includes the Mayor of Antakya, Lutfu Savas, who is from Kilicdaroglu's party. We meet at a cluster of temporary buildings that now serve as his office. \"He [Erdogan] is the leader of a political party that has been able to stay in power for 21 years,\" he says - longer than anyone else, even Turkey's founding father, Kemal Ataturk. \"Despite all the difficulties - economic, social and resulting from the earthquake - he knows how to use politics, and all the instruments of the state for victory.\" President Erdogan and his Justice and Development (AK) Party will certainly be helped by his grip on the Turkish media. The government controls 90% of the national media, according to the press freedom group, Reporters without Borders. What happens here matters beyond Turkey's borders. The country is a regional heavyweight, facing both East and West. Its neighbours and its Nato allies will be watching closely. Many analysts believe the contest will go to a second round on 28 May because neither presidential candidate will get more than 50% in the first ballot. Back at the cemetery, change cannot come soon enough for Fethiye, who is scarred by memories of prising her dead son from the rubble - with her bare hands, and only her relatives for help. \"Turkey is finished,\" she says. \"When Erdogan leaves, Turkey will rise.\"",

      "title": "Arab League: Syria reinstated as Assad rehabilitation continues",
      "text": "Syria is back in the influential Arab League, more than a decade after being thrown out for its brutal repression of pro-democracy protests, which led to the ongoing civil war. The move is further evidence of a thaw in relations between Damascus and other Arab governments. Syria's readmittance was approved at a meeting of League members in Egypt. It comes ahead of a summit in Saudi Arabia later this month that President Bashar al-Assad may now attend. In a statement, Syria's foreign ministry said it had received the League's decision \"with great attention\" and called for \"greater Arab cooperation and partnership\". Foreign ministers from 13 of the 22-nation group's members were present when the decision to readmit Syria was taken. They stressed the need to end Syria's civil war and the resulting refugee and drug smuggling crises. Growing poverty and lack of job opportunities saw many turn to the drug trade, the BBC reported last year. A committee involving Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq will be set up to help Syria achieve those goals. The Arab League's secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said the move was the start of a process to resolve the crisis in Syria, which would be \"gradual\". He stressed the decision did not mean a resumption of relationships between Arab states and Syria as it was up to each country to decide this individually. More than 300,000 civilians are thought to have been killed and more than 100,000 detained or disappeared during the civil war, according to UN estimates. Roughly half of the pre-war population of 21 million has been displaced, either within Syria or as refugees abroad. Mr Assad began to regain control over the country in 2015, with the help of Russia - forcing its neighbours to think of a future with Mr Assad in place. Arab moves to restore ties accelerated after the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria in February. Earlier this week, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi visited Mr Assad - with some analysts suggesting the visit put extra pressure on Arab nations to bring Syria back into the fold. It follows visits by foreign ministers from Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Tunisia. Syria's foreign minister has also recently visited several Arab countries as part of a diplomatic push. The US and UK are among the Western countries that have recently stated they will not restore relations with President Assad's government.",

      "title": "Napoli win Serie A for first time in 33 years to spark street party - BBC Sport",
      "text": "The city of Naples was transformed into an epic street party. The reason? On Thursday, Napoli became the champions of Italy. As soon as the final whistle was blown in their game at Udinese, with Napoli's 1-1 draw enough to clinch the Serie A title, hundreds of people crammed together in piazzas, singing of their joy. \"We have one dream in our heart. For Naples to become champions again!\" rang round the city, for that dream has now come true. \"I have been crying. This is a historic moment,\" Edoardo Nappa says. The 13-year-old is part of a new generation too young to remember the glory days of Diego Maradona - the legendary maverick who delivered two Serie A titles to the city when he was Napoli captain. \"To be able to experience this, to live this myself for the first time… it's magical. It's a historic moment for Naples.\" It wasn't only locals who were partying; people from all over Italy and countries including France, Spain and the UK travelled to Naples to soak up the spectacle. Naples lives and breathes football. The whole city has been decorated in readiness for the party: blue and white flags and festoons hang above the narrow streets. Life-size cardboard cutouts have popped up in the city centre. There are cakes, pastries, drinks, ice creams dedicated to the players. \"It feels like the world has stopped here,\" says Amelia Bufi, a university student who travelled from Rome to celebrate the victory. \"This party is going to go on for at least a month. It's going to last through the summer. It's an amazing feeling: Neapolitans put love in everything they do, including football.\" A party planned for three decades This is a party 33 years in the making. The last time Napoli won the Serie A title was 1990 - when Maradona was captain. The Argentine's influence can still be felt in the city. His face is painted on bar windows, bumper stickers and billboards. A giant mural of him towers above a shrine dedicated to him. And above it is a sign that says 'Dios' - the Spanish word for God. Many have this week been gathering around his shrine to lay flowers and light candles. Some have had tears in their eyes. For Neapolitans, football is almost a religious experience. \"It goes even beyond religion,\" says Bufi. \"What we are doing here is like a ritual. We are praying for Diego Maradona, as if he were a saint. It's crazy and I love it.\" Maradona, who died in 2020, gave Neapolitans a great sense of belonging. \"He was a man that was full of vices but at the same time poetic and majestic in what he did best,\" says European football expert Mina Rzouki. \"And that is very much something that resonates with Neapolitans.\" Memories of glory days were fading After Maradona delivered his second title for Napoli more than three decades ago, the team could not sustain the success. They had financial struggles, went bankrupt and were demoted to Serie C - the lowest league of the professional divisions. The turning point came in 2004: film producer Aurelio de Laurentiis bought the club. \"He created a team that is wonderful to watch,\" Rzouki says. \"He knew he could depend on the unconditional love of an entire city, on a fan base that is so devoted. So under him, Napoli grew.\" And yet, Napoli couldn't replicate the success of 1990 and win the title. \"The deep pressure of playing in a city that lives football to a degree that is so unimaginable… it can be a lot. It can become suffocating to be in a city that is so devoted to their success,\" says Rzouki. Revenge of the underdogs This win is about so much more than football. It's a symbol of the inequality between Italy's wealthy north and the poorer south. \"Young Neapolitans are often forced to emigrate to northern Italy in search of a job and a better life,\" says Napoli Today journalist Franco Romano. \"And so for them, winning the league is a form of social revenge against the superpowers of the north.\" \"To win the league anywhere south of Rome is like winning 10 trophies in Milan or Turin,\" says another fan, Enrico. Neapolitans still endure hostile taunts from their northern rivals about crime, poverty and even cholera outbreaks. \"If you were born in Naples, football is part of your blood,\" says Gaetano, who is dressed head-to-toe in football kit. \"Our blood is [Napoli] blue, it's not red.\" One of the thousands of Neapolitans who has moved to Milan to find work, he travelled to Naples with his whole family to experience this moment. He wants to share his passion for football with them. \"It's something that comes from the heart. I've been waiting 33 years for this win. I am full of emotion, of passion, of faith… words cannot explain what I'm feeling.\" A consecration of Naples When Naples won the league thanks to Maradona, the city had been destroyed by a violent earthquake a few years previously. \"The city was struggling. Poverty was everywhere,\" says Massimo Romano. \"The win with Maradona represented a rebirth for Naples after a time of extreme difficulty.\" But things are very different now. \"Naples still has a lot of problems, but it's become a European city with lots of tourists, one that is well known outside of Italy,\" adds Romano. For a city that is so devoted to its football team, this is a day that will be cherished for years to come. \"Today's victory represents the consecration to a success that Naples has been experiencing for several years.\"",

      "title": "Syria on way back to Arab fold as isolation crumbles",
      "text": "They look like unlikely allies, but on Wednesday the moustachioed, secular Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is warmly welcoming the bearded, turban-wearing Islamist cleric-cum-President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, to Damascus. It is the first such visit by an Iranian leader since 2010, before the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then, Tehran has proved the staunchest of allies, helping - along with Moscow - to save the Assad regime during a particularly bloody civil war. The trip comes amid dramatic shifts in the region. These have also seen the Syrian president and his entourage - long shunned as pariahs in the Arab world - recently being embraced, quite literally on occasion, by their neighbours. Despite opposition from the US and Europe, it is becoming the norm for Arab states to take steps to normalise ties with Syria. Syria still hopes to be granted observer status at the Arab League summit in Riyadh on 19 May, ahead of its eventual reinstatement. \"The international community outside of the region - Russia aside - has largely washed its hands of responsibility for Syria,\" comments Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu). \"There is a vacuum and this is where the regional powers have come in. [They see that] if nothing is going to change, if there is not going to be a real political process, then we as a region cannot afford to ignore Syria. It's too big and significant a country.\" The turnaround is remarkable. Back in late 2011, many Arab states were clearly planning for a post-Assad era when Syria was censured and suspended by the 22-member Arab League. I watched hundreds of Syrians waving flags and chanting their support of that move, close to the League's headquarters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. At that time there had been a brutal crackdown on Syrian pro-democracy protesters and I had reported on waves of refugees fleeing the fighting. But many of the regime's worst atrocities - the indiscriminate barrel bombing and poison gas attacks - were still to come. Now, over a decade on, the figures are jaw-dropping: about half of the Syrian population has been displaced or made refugees, and the UN conservatively estimates that more than 300,000 civilians have been killed and more than 100,000 detained or disappeared. It was Russia's military involvement in Syria in 2015 that changed the course of the bloody civil war and forced its neighbours to begin thinking of a future that left Mr Assad in place \"That was a game-changer for Jordan,\" says Osama al-Sharif, a prominent journalist in Amman, stressing how his country was facing a national security threat and turned to Moscow to apply pressure. \"At the time the war against Daesh [the Islamic State militant group] was also going on... We had [the Lebanese militant group] Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups positioned very close to the border.\" President Assad went on to consolidate control over much of Syria, but Arab moves to restore ties accelerated after this February's massive earthquake in Turkey and Syria - with the rush to bring in aid. Then came the China-brokered re-establishment of relations between regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia and its rival, Iran, which have supported opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. In the past few weeks, a beaming Mr Assad has been greeted in Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Abu Dhabi, his wife, Asma, joined him for her first known official trip abroad in a decade, and was hugged on the tarmac by the wife of the UAE president. Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister has been off to Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Jordan. The Saudis stressed that they were discussing \"the return of Syria to its Arab fold\". However, there are deep divisions between the Arab states on how and when to rehabilitate Syria. Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Jordan have apparently pushed back against plans by Saudi Arabia and the UAE for its rapid reinstallation at the Arab League. \"There seems to be a rush to restore relations with Syria but when asked, no-one could say what guarantees were being sought in return for normalisation,\" says an official from the region with knowledge of recent talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"It's a pity. It sends the wrong message. It says there are no consequences,\" the official continues, adding that the Syrians are acting \"in a very arrogant way, like everyone else is lucky to have them\". The US is clear that it does not support restoring ties nor lifting tough economic sanctions on an unapologetic, unreformed Damascus. In March, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said: \"This regime deserves to be treated as the rogue that it is.\" However, she also urged Arab allies opting to end Mr Assad's isolation to \"make sure that you get something\". She suggested trying to end the trade in Captagon, an illegal drug which is produced in Syria and smuggled out. As I have seen at a hospital treating young addicts from Jordan and the Arab Gulf, this amphetamine - known as \"poor man's cocaine\" - is fast turning Syria into a narco-state and sowing seeds of misery across the Arab world. Other demands could be a reduction in Iran's military presence in Syria and setting conditions that would allow more refugees to return home or safeguard people living in parts of Syria still under opposition control. After years with little progress in talks with the fragmented Syrian opposition, many Arab states would also like to see at least a token effort by Damascus to re-engage. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is pushing for this. \"This renewed attention to Syria is very important if it can act as a circuit breaker and unlock long-stalled efforts to move the political process forward,\" he told the UN Security Council on 27 April. Many Syrians will feel let down by the new Arab overtures. Millions living in the remaining opposition-held pockets once viewed Saudi Arabia and other Arab states as allies in their struggle against Mr Assad's rule. They now find themselves more isolated. Refugees, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey - where acceptance has dwindled in the light of economic crises - are increasingly worried about the risk of forced returns. Turkey - which has been a main backer of Syrian armed opposition groups - has also been talking to Damascus. Almost all parties campaigning for its 14 May elections say they want to send Syrians home. \"We're extremely afraid about the election results. They clearly state that they want to deport us,\" says a Syrian refugee, Muhammad, in his Istanbul coffee shop. Human rights activists express huge disappointment that there is little reference to past atrocities in conversations about Syria's rehabilitation. \"It's shocking,\" says Diana Semaan, Syria researcher for Amnesty International. \"What we're seeing now is a complete disregard to the human rights records of the Syrian government and a message being sent that it doesn't matter what's happened.\" Amnesty urges Arab countries to use their influence with the regime to try to prevent further attacks on civilians and arbitrary detentions and torture. There are calls for co-operation as the UN tries to set up an international body to help families of those missing to find out the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. Meanwhile, in Geneva, a team of lawyers continues busily working to support the prosecutions of those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. The UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) for Syria has already helped in 267 cases, including 28 so far this year. Its head, Catherine Marchi-Uhel says: \"The fight against impunity is ongoing and will continue to be pursued.\" Some Syrians hope that normalisation in the region could mark the start of a return to normal life. Residents of government-held Syria are grappling with rocketing inflation and crippling power shortages. According to the UN, even before February's devastating earthquake hit Syria, 15.3 million people - 70% of the population - were in need of humanitarian assistance. However, Heiko Wimmen, who oversees International Crisis Group's work on Syria, stresses that, at this stage, Arab Gulf states are unlikely to contribute much to the billions of dollars needed to rebuild Syria's ruined cities. \"American sanctions are only one part of that problem. It's a very forbidding environment economically. You need some trappings of a functioning state and functioning governance, some basic level of accountability,\" he says. In order to survive, over the years the cash-strapped Syrian regime has raided and seized dozens of businesses. It stands accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid meant for impoverished Syrians, as well as alleged drug trafficking. It is an irony that the problems caused by the Syrian government ensure that it can no longer be ignored by its neighbours - even if Syria's war and its fallout have largely fallen off world news bulletins.",

      "title": "Dog diplomacy: Turkey sends Mexico puppy after search dog's death",
      "text": "A German Shepherd puppy is on its way to Mexico from Turkey as a gesture of gratitude from the Turkish government for the help Mexico's search and rescue dogs lent after February's earthquake. Turkey said it hoped the puppy would \"carry on the legacy\" of Proteo, a Mexican rescue dog which died during the search for survivors of the quake. Mexico said Turkey's canine gift showed that \"humanitarian aid knows no limits or borders\". The puppy is yet to be named. Mexico's ministry of defence, which trains search and rescue dogs for their missions at home and abroad, has asked people to cast their votes for one of three names: Proteo II, Arkadas (Turkish for \"friend\") or Yardim (Turkish for \"help\"). On its Twitter account, the ministry has also provided a link on which fans of the puppy can track the flight which is taking it to Mexico City from Istanbul. Mexico, a country prone to earthquakes, has civilian and military teams with canine units specialised in searching for survivors when disasters strike. The dogs won the hearts of many Mexicans when they saved several lives after the 2017 earthquake which struck central Mexico. When Turkey and Syria were hit by a massive quake on 6 February, Mexico quickly deployed teams with rescue dogs to help locate people under the rubble. Among the dogs deployed was Proteo, a nine-year-old German Shepherd, who managed to locate a man and a woman from under the rubble. Proteo died while in Turkey. His trainer denied rumours that the dog had been hit by falling rubble, saying that he had died from \"exhaustion\" after the long journey and arduous hours searching for survivors in very cold conditions. His remains were returned to Mexico, where he was honoured in an emotional ceremony before he was buried. On its Facebook page, Mexico's ministry of defence said that it was \"waiting with open arms\" for the puppy Turkey had donated, saying that it hoped it would follow in his pawsteps.",

      "title": "Living on the frontlines of a US-China flashpoint",
      "text": "The largest ever military exercises between the United States and the Philippines are drawing to a close. They began just days after China's military rehearsed a blockade of Taiwan - a display the US called disproportionate. With tensions high in the region, a handful of people on a few small islands find themselves caught between two superpowers. Life is fragile in Itbayat. The steep limestone cliffs and rolling hills that make up this tiny island on the northern edge of the Philippines rise out of the Luzon Strait. Even on a good day, strong waves on the azure seas toss around tiny fishing boats hoping to hook some of the islanders' favourite flying fish. Nearly 3,000 native Ivatans, fishermen and farmers, have survived here in the face of earthquakes, typhoons and drought. But now they face a new and different threat. Their island home risks being caught in a conflict between the United States and China as the two militaries skirt ever closer to each other to gain the upper hand in the South China Sea. At the heart of the issue is Taiwan. China's claims over the self-governing island are growing louder even as the US' commitment to defend it appears to be deepening. And these islands - Itbayat and Basco - that make up the far-flung Philippine archipelago of Batanes are in the line of crossfire. They appear as mere dots in the ocean that surrounds them. But their proximity to Taiwan - it's just 156km (96 miles) from Itbayat - has made them both strategic allies and vulnerable foes. Analysts often talk of rising tensions between the two superpowers, but what is it like to live in the biggest flashpoint between Beijing and Washington? Itbayat can often be cut off for weeks. It certainly looks impenetrable. Small ports are carved out of the cliffs and getting to a boat involves clambering down steep steps cut into the rock face. The colour of the water hugging the land is a deep turquoise - and so clear you can watch small fish play amongst the coral. Itbayat feels untouched by man, other than the indigenous community who've made it their home. Few here have televisions. A network of relayed messages from house to house, or through the church congregation is often more reliable than the patchy phone signal. But they don't need TV news or social media to tell them about the turbulent relationship between the US and China which threatens their shores. It's closer than it has ever been. Crouched down, eyes fixed through the viewfinders of their weapons and head to toe in camouflage are the members of the US Army's 25th Infantry Division training on the island of Basco. They are practising to defend the island from potential aggressors. The exercise is part of the largest combat drills ever held between the US and the Philippines. Out at sea, the mission was controlled from the USS Miguel Keith, a naval ship, while V-22 Osprey aircraft hovered over the island, much to the amazement of locals who grabbed their mobile phones to film. The simulation even involved rocket launchers being shipped to the beaches using amphibious landing craft. \"The goal of our campaign in this region is to deter conflict from ever occurring,\" says Major General Joseph Ryan, the commanding general of the 25th Infantry Division. \"We don't want a war with the PRC [People's Republic of China]. We do not want that, we do not desire that and we are not provoking that. A war with the PRC is good for nobody.\" But, he admits, the two forces are sending a message. \"The message sent is we're ready, we're capable, we're prepared. We've got a great partnership here. And we mean business.\" The two sides are certainly arming themselves; as is the whole of Asia. China is still the region's biggest spender on new military hardware, with this year's defence budget the highest it's ever been, around $224bn. The US, in turn, has been keen to show off its capabilities, holding ever more military drills with allies throughout the region, including Japan, South Korea and Australia. For Washington this is not just about a display of shiny new arms. It is also about shoring up alliances - the White House has been dispatching envoys more often than usual to Asia, hoping to stitch together a sturdy coalition to counter China. And that includes the Philippines, whose location is an asset. \"The situation is heating up,\" admitted Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos in a recent interview with a local radio station ahead of his visit to Washington this week. He has decided to take a more assertive approach to China than his predecessor and that includes ordering more patrols by the Navy and the Coastguard. But what would be largely uneventful patrols elsewhere have the potential to turn into a conflict in the South China Sea, where even fishing could ignite a geopolitical crisis. Beijing claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea - a strategic waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually - despite an international court ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. \"The Chinese fishermen used to harass us,\" says 59-year-old Cyrus Malupa, as he casts a single wire line with a metal hook into the sea. \"But when we reported that to the government, it placed a military base on Mavulis Island to the north. Now we have Philippine Marines there on duty,\" he adds. In March, the Navy started a month-long mission on the uninhabited island, described it as the country's \"first line of defence\" and raised the Filipino flag on its highest peak. A small but bold act of sovereignty. For Cyrus and others who live in tiny boats for days in the hope of catching enough tuna to sell at the local market, the geopolitical dispute is personal. It's about feeding their families. Hundreds of Filipino fishermen have reported incidents of being driven away from their traditional fishing grounds in the South China Sea for more than a decade - particularly in the contested seas near the Spratly Islands. \"We don't have that much catch because the poachers have more advanced technology,\" Cyrus says as the tiny boat bounces over the white horses now forming on the water. \"Us locals use the old way of fishing like lines and smaller nets. But the poachers have more advanced technology so they can catch as much as they can.\" Manila has filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea - where Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping territorial claims. It's natural to be worried because any conflict will affect our lives,\" said 51-year-old Victor Gonzales. \"First, we are afraid for our lives and then there is the possible exodus of people coming here from Taiwan as we have limited resources.\" Like most on Itbayat, Victor farms when the sea is rough and goes out to fish when it is fair. Crops are raised by hand, with no help from machinery or fertilisers. Instead, farmers rotate sweet potato, rice, corn, garlic and onions. A single farm can feed around 25 families. \"We need to protect our resources because it's how we live, and we don't have any alternative. We want to have something to pass onto the next generation,\" Victor says. The concern runs deep enough that leaders of local governments in the Batanes islands announced to reporters last December that they would secure food supplies to prepare for a possible conflict. The restricted signs around the Camilo Osias naval base on the beaches of Santa Ana are hand-painted and difficult to make out - almost obscured by the dozens of green fishing boats moored along the sand. It's Sunday and a few of the men who would usually be at sea are getting tipsy in the shade on a Filipino brand of gin. A handful of water buffalo wallow in the shallows flicking off the birds that come to rest on their backs with their tails. Nearby, women are doing the weekly washing in huge tubs - the suds spilling over the sides. Santa Ana is a sleepy town on the northern tip of the main island of Luzon. There is little activity around the tiny Filipino naval base which is so tucked away on a corner of the beach that you would barely know it was there - unless you spotted the \"restricted\" signs. Crucially it has an airstrip that will give the US access to the Taiwan Strait. \"It's not really a base. I would say it is more like a Boy Scout camp,\" exclaims Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba. This is one of the four new bases in the Philippines that US troops can access as the two countries boost their military alliance. Two of the new locations are in the northern province of Cagayan and face Taiwan. \"This is not my call or the call of our people. It's the call of our national leaders. We will abide by it. We may disagree with it, but really it's all because we don't want war,\" says Mr Mamba. \"We are poor, and we have our local problems too. That is why any cause of uncertainty will be a bigger problem for all of us.\" Mr Mamba is worried that having two US bases in his province will make it a target. He had hoped to bring Chinese tourists to the region, or build a new international airport. Now he fears that Beijing may snub the Philippines when it needs their business more than ever. \"It is hard for us to choose between the two of them. Between a neighbour who has never been our enemy and an ally who has stood by us through so many difficulties. If they could be together, if only they could talk, if only there was middle ground for them to meet.\" Governor Mamba's comments reflect a growing anxiety across parts of Asia. Will they be forced to choose between a long standing ally, the US, and their largest trade partner, China? Back in Basco, in the capital of the tiny Philippine province of the Batanes islands, 21-year-old Ave Marie Garcia is helping travellers get flights to and from her home island of Itbayat. She doesn't keep an eye on the news - but she couldn't fail to notice or hear about the latest military exercises. \"I don't think the US is going to cause war with these military exercises. It's just the US is trying to help the Philippine military to protect this island and to let the Chinese know that this region is protected,\" she says as she jumps on her scooter to show us her favourite views and beaches. Ave is one of 11 children and like many in the Philippines, her mother works abroad to send money back to the family. Their ancestral home, a traditional stone cottage which has stood through the centuries, lies in ruins after an earthquake in 2019 - a reminder that life is fragile here. Ave and her siblings were brought up by what she describes as her strict grandmother. But in Ave there are small signs of rebellion. Her long dark hair is dip-dyed blonde at the ends. And yet, she is an Ivatan at heart. Her hope is to preserve her ancestors' way of life, even if that means saying no to the United States. She believes there should be limits. \"I am worried about the future - for our future. I hope they won't build structures here for the U.S military, I just want to leave it as it is. They are allowed to visit this place but they are not allowed to build something here that will cause anyone to invade us. For me it's scary.\" The people here feel miles away from the politics and the bellicose rhetoric, and they try not to dwell on what could be, and enjoy what they have. \"An island life is a simple life,\" Ave says. Each day, she and her family pray it will stay that way.",

      "title": "Turkish mass arrests target Kurdish areas ahead of election",
      "text": "Turkish police have detained at least 126 people suspected of links to a banned Kurdish militant group, ahead of an election that could bring down President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish reports said those held across 21 provinces were suspected of financing and helping to recruit for the outlawed PKK. The suspects included lawyers, journalists and politicians. The main pro-Kurdish party said the arrests were timed to affect the vote. Nineteen days before Turks vote in presidential and parliamentary elections, the HDP said those detained included lawyers who could scrutinise election security, independent journalists, who could cover potential voter fraud, and party campaign managers. Turkey's state news agency Anadolu said some of those held in Tuesday's raids were linked to 60 street protests as well as child abductions, and were led by public prosecutors in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. The HDP denies links to the militant PKK, which is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and European Union. It is considered Turkey's second largest opposition party but has seen thousands of its members jailed, including former joint leader Selahattin Demirtas. In 2019, dozens of elected HDP mayors were removed because of \"terror charges\", condemned by their party as a coup against voters. In a bid to avoid a possible court ban on running for parliament on 14 May it has nominated its candidates under the banner of a new Green Left party. The elections are being seen as Turkey's most significant for years, with six opposition parties uniting behind a single candidate in Kemal Kilicdaroglu. The HDP is not part of that so-called Table of Six but has backed his candidacy. Mr Kilicdaroglu leads the Republican People's Party (CHP) and opinion polls give him a realistic chance of defeating Turkey's long-time leader Mr Erdogan, who has been in power for more than 20 years. He has accused Mr Erdogan's ruling AK Party of stigmatising millions of Turkish Kurds as terrorists to consolidate nationalist votes. President Erdogan has obtained sweeping powers in recent years, turning a largely ceremonial role into an elected post with the ability to appoint judges and declare a state of emergency, with the resulting power of ruling by decree. His popularity has been dented by soaring inflation of over 50% and by his response to the double earthquake in February, which killed more than 50,000 people in 11 provinces and has left thousands homeless. Earlier this month, Mr Erdogan accused the centre-left CHP of surrendering to the agenda of the pro-Kurdish party and the PKK \"terror group\". The first round of the presidential election takes places on the same day as the parliamentary vote. If no presidential candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, a second round run-off follows two weeks later on 28 May.",

      "title": "Haruki Murakami: Readers drawn to enigmatic appeal of Japanese author",
      "text": "Throngs of fans joined late night queues outside bookstores across Japan last week, eager to lay their hands on Haruki Murakami's new novel - his first in six years. At one Tokyo bookstore, which hung a two-storey LED banner counting down the time to release, copies of The City And Its Uncertain Walls were snapped up at midnight. Many readers dived straight in upon getting their copy. Pictures online showed readers curled up in all-night cafes, with cups of coffee by their side. The new novel, which the 74-year-old wrote in isolation during the pandemic, follows the protagonist's journey into a city surrounded by high walls. The 661-page read is divided into three parts, in which the protagonist moves from his teenage years into middle age. But plot is perhaps the least important element in Murakami's novels which are known for their meandering magical-realist storylines. For many readers, the plot points are merely jumping-off points for explorations of loss, isolation, identity and increasingly, social and political events. The latest book was written during the pandemic. \"I started writing this novel in early March 2020, when the coronavirus started raging in Japan, and it took me almost three years to finish,\" Murakami said in the book's statement issued by his publisher Shinchosha. He hardly went out or took long trips during those years, he said. \"In this quite extraordinary, tense environment, I diligently wrote this piece, as if a 'dreamreader' reads 'old dreams' in a library,\" he added. It is that kind of enigmatic line that sends his legion of fans around the world into frenzy. In anticipation of the book's release, a bookstore in Nagoya city put up a capsule machine dispensing sentences from his novels. Six years isn't the longest time between books, and Murakami has been prolific over a four-decade career. He's produced at least 14 novels and several short-story collections with works translated into more than 50 languages. But the overwhelming reception to his latest book reflects his enduring popularity, particularly in his homeland. One longtime Murakami reader, Yu, told the BBC the appeal of his works is how he connects the \"two worlds\" of dreams and reality. \"Sometimes they are 'me' and sometimes they are 'not me', and that creates a sense of absorption. For me, his novels are like warm and soft mud. You get comfortably drawn and absorbed into these stories,\" she said. The 36-year-old read the entirety of the new book in one sitting on Thursday, the day after it was released. She attacked it with the same enthusiasm as when she first picked up a Murakami work more than 20 years ago, at the recommendation of her primary school teacher. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Part of the joy of picking up a Murakami book is sinking into a world of established motifs, readers have said. Murakami tropes are so well known they even inspired a bingo cartoon, published in the NY Times' Sunday Book Review in 2014. Murakami bingo includes an \"ear fetish, a \"mysterious woman\" or \"faceless villain\", \"urban ennui\", \"Tokyo at night\" and various supernatural spookiness and things vanishing. \"I think Murakami's worlds sit so well with many people across the world because he is beyond culture in a way,\" said Gitte Marianne Hansen, a lecturer in Japanese Studies at Newcastle University. \"His stories speak to the core of humanity in our inner modern lives and this is what we respond to as readers. The core feeling of loneliness and alienation is probably beyond culture,\" said Dr Hansen, who has translated Mr Murakami's short stories. However, the author has been increasingly criticised for his portrayal of women. Critics say female characters in Mr Murakami's books are often sexualised or defined only in relation to the male protagonists. Mr Murakami himself said in a 2004 interview with The Paris Review: \"If the sex is good... Your injury will be healed, your imagination will be invigorated... In that sense, in my stories, women are mediums - harbingers of the coming world. That's why they always come to my protagonist; he doesn't go to them.\" This is simply \"the male voice that [Mr Murakami] privileges\", says Michael Tsang, a Japanese Studies lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. His dominance illustrates that Japan \"needs to do more about gender and other minority groups.\" But for some, the misogyny in Mr Murakami's works is hard to overlook, and that could be one reason as to why literature's biggest honour has eluded him for so many years. \"Hello Japan's pundits, Haruki Murakami will not get a Nobel prize unless he gets rid of all his misogyny... Pin your hopes on a better Japanese writer,\" one Twitter user argued. \"The sexualisation of an underage girl, as well as detailed descriptions of the voluptuousness of her body, can be considered problematic per today's literary context,\" said Koichiro Sukegawa, a Japanese literature professor at Gifu Women's University. The new book is a radical rewrite of his novella of the same name, first published in a magazine in 1980. The author said he believed more could be mined from the material. Mr Murakami's writing has always been seen to offer a \"cool, Japanese culture that is exported to the rest of the world, said Dr Hansen. Much of his work can be read against the backdrop of the Japanese economic recessions in the 1980s and 1990s. But it doesn't preclude readers from other cultures from understanding him. \"In fact, it is remarkable that his work can reach such a wide readership despite being set mostly in Japan and speaking to a very 'Japanese' social fabric,\" said Dr Tsang. His short story Sleep, published in 1993 about a housewife who struggles to go to bed at night, was viewed as a response to Japanese family and gender norms. He has also written and spoken about the nuclear disasters and earthquakes that have ravaged Japan. Mr Murakami's works have also inspired other forms of art. The Oscar-winning film Japanese film Drive My Car was based on several of the author's short stories, including one of the same title. His latest book has flown off the shelves. Shinchosha announced an initial print run of 300,000 copies and had sold more than half by the end of the first week. On Wednesday they announced a second re-print. Two volumes of his previous novel Killing Commendatore, published in February 2017, saw 700,000 and 600,000 orders respectively. An English translation of Mr Murakami's newest title will be made available later this year.",

      "title": "Syria earthquake: Survivors in Idlib feel forgotten",
      "text": "Sedra remembers the moment the earthquake struck. The 13-year-old was out of her wheelchair, asleep inside her home in north-west Syria. She and her brother Abdullah could not get to safety. \"We screamed for help and no one could hear us,\" she tells me. \"Everyone in the building had left, but we were stuck in there because the door handle broke.\" \"I thought I had lost my family,\" recalls Ali Muhammad, Sedra and Abdullah's father. \"The hallway was filled with rubble, but we managed to carry the children out and lay them down outside on solar panels that had fallen into the street.\" \"They were terrified and crying. We covered them in blankets, but the rain was pouring heavily.\" The family's home was so badly damaged that they are now living in a tent. \"Life right now is very difficult. Living in tents is miserable, but we thank Allah that we are alive,\" Ali says. Sedra and Abdullah both have cerebral palsy and osteoporosis, and need special care. But now there is no bathroom for them, no kitchen, no water. It is difficult for Sedra to manoeuvre her wheelchair across the stones left by the collapsed buildings, but she is resilient. She beams as we talk about the princess-covered schoolbag stuffed with books next to her in the chair. But when she remembers the quake, her face is different, still filled with fear. \"I'm scared of another earthquake,\" she says. Syria's children know trauma all too acutely. The country was already suffering badly from the effects of 12 years of war. More than 7,000 people died in February's devastating quake and for those who survived the situation is now even tougher. According to the UN, more than four million people in north-west Syria depend on humanitarian aid, the majority of them women and children. In each place we travelled to, earthquake survivors told me they felt forgotten and still had not received the help they badly needed. At least 148 communities in north-west Syria have been affected by the earthquakes. A few miles from Sedra's home, on the side of a hill, the sun beats down on a peaceful, tranquil spot. In the last few weeks, this cemetery has doubled in size. Some graves are older, almost hidden from view by tall grasses and purple flowers. But row upon row of them are fresh, marked out by white breezeblocks on the neatly-dug brown earth. Birds sing in the ancient olive trees and the view into the valley is a beautiful panorama of green trees and fields all the way to the edge of Syria and the mountains that mark the Turkish border. Ali Sheikh Hazem Ghannam walks slowly through the cemetery. Some 61 members of his family are buried here. \"Everyone was sleeping and we felt the earthquake strongly,\" Hazem says. \"The sound was very loud and the building was shaking left and right.\" \"We went down into the street, multiple buildings just collapsed. It was like a minor apocalypse, we spent days unable to process what had happened.\" Many of the victims were only children, crushed when the upper floors of their buildings crashed down upon them as they slept. As Hazem walks through the rows of graves, he gestures. \"Here we have Adil Ghannam, his wife, and his kids, and we have Allam Ghannam, his wife and kids. Ayman Ghannam and his family are over there, they are my cousins.\" More than 10,500 buildings across north-west Syria were fully or partially destroyed by the tremor. Hazem takes us to meet the family members who survived. One of them, Nada, lies in bed inside the tent her family now sleeps in, an intravenous drip hanging from the canvas wall. After the men leave, she and her mother carefully lift the bedclothes to show me her injuries. Her pelvis and legs were crushed, and white surgical dressings swathe her hips. The pain is constant. In the damaged home which still stands next door, her children are lying on the sofa, carefully resting their wounded legs. Mustafa and Mohamed quietly watch television. In other countries, Nada and her children would still be in hospital, in a clean ward surrounded by medical staff. But that level of resource just does not exist here. Hospitals in rebel-held Idlib province have been overwhelmed for years, and there is only space for the most serious cases to stay and recover. \"We have already been suffering from the war and everything that the criminal Bashar al-Assad has done to us,\" Hazem says. \"From shelling and displacement to siege. \"Then this earthquake came and increased our suffering even more. We had hope in the past that we would overcome the injustice, but now our hope has turned to pain.\" The situation in Syria is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. In the days after the earthquake, even as countries geared up to respond, aid was slow to reach Syria. New tents and medical supplies were desperately needed as well as earth-moving equipment and specialised teams to look for survivors in the ruins. Those who live here say the delay cost lives. As we speed along the winding roads, we spot a scene of destruction near the crest of a hill. Diggers tear through the smashed concrete and twisted metal, sending clouds of dust into the air. Around 300 people died when this single building collapsed. Weeks after the quake, it is impossible to say whether every lifeless body has been recovered from underneath the rubble. Here in Syria, the process is slow. There simply is not enough heavy machinery for every town and village to clear away the debris quickly. Across Idlib, the destruction wrought by conflict merges into the damage caused by the earthquake. The scars of a long war are everywhere and they have made people resilient. Homemade shelters that fell apart during the earthquake have been patched back together. A bustling market has been set up right on the edge of a yawning hole where another multi-storey building fell to the ground and was cleared away. People browse an open-air rail of clothes and a woman spreads out a blanket picked from a bundle laid out on the road. When the quake came, it hit these already-struggling communities hard. Many already lacked safe shelter, like Um Soliman and her extended family of children and grandchildren. Their home had already been half-destroyed in an airstrike. The upper floors have been scythed away from the rest of the building, walls and floors are missing, doors open onto nothingness, just a long drop to the ground below. \"Since the war started, we have not had one good day,\" Um Soliman tells me, \"and then the earthquake happened and it made us more scared. When the aircraft used to shell us we prayed to Allah, but now this came from Allah.\" When the earthquake shook this house, they were terrified, knowing that it did not provide the protection they needed. More chunks of masonry crumbled away as the family ran outside. They were lucky to survive. Despite it all, it is still their only real source of shelter. They are too scared to sleep in here, but during the day it is still the place where they cook and gather. Pulling back the curtain that divides the hallway from the outdoors reveals a tiny baby sleeping peacefully at the foot of the cracked walls. The family are warm and welcoming, desperate to show the reality of their living situation but painfully aware that it is dangerous for any of us to be inside the precarious building. Any thoughts of reconstruction are still far away. In neighbouring Turkey, an ambitious rebuilding programme has become a pre-election campaign. In Syria though, for now, clearing the debris of collapsed buildings is the best most people can manage. Creating new ones would need materials that are already in short supply. In Um Soliman's house, the children play carefully. They try to avoid the cracked walls and the constant fear in the eyes of the adults. \"We are scared of everything, but where will we go,\" she asks, taking my hand in hers. \"We have set up a tent outside, and when things get worse here we will move to it. The kids are always crying and their screams are everywhere. What can we do? We pray this never happens to anyone else.\"",

      "title": "IS truffle picker attacks: At least 26 killed in Syrian desert ambush",
      "text": "At least 26 people searching for valuable truffles in the Syrian desert have been killed by the Islamic State group, state media and activists say. Civilians and pro-government fighters were among the victims of the attack on Sunday in Hama province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. IS militants have repeatedly preyed on those searching for the fungus, with more than 150 people killed this year. A kilogram (2.2lb) can fetch more than the country's average monthly wage. Syria's state-run Sana news agency cited a police source as saying that IS militants attacked a group of civilians in the village of Duwaizin, in the eastern countryside of Hama, killing 26 of them. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group that relies on a wide network of sources on the ground in Syria, put the death toll at 36 and said the victims included at least 17 fighters from the pro-government National Defence Forces. Searching for the truffles is extremely dangerous as hunters contend with landmines and IS fighters maintain hideouts in the desert where they grow. But many who face poverty and unemployment exacerbated by Syria's war risk the dangers as the fungus can sell for up to US$25 (£20) per kg depending on size and grade in a country where the average monthly wage is around $18 (£14). The window of time in which to make money is small as the truffle season only lasts from February to April. There have been several attacks on foragers in recent months, with women and children among the victims. Last month, 15 truffle hunters were killed in central Syria, according to the SOHR. Dozens of others were also reported to have gone missing. Another incident in February saw dozens of people massacred in an ambush in the western region of Homs, carried out by gunmen who suddenly appeared out of the desert on motorbikes. Days earlier, 16 people, mostly civilians, were killed in a similar attack targeting foragers in the same area. In 2014, IS militants seized large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people. The group was driven from its last piece of territory in 2019, but it is estimated to still have 5,000 to 7,000 members and supporters spread between the two countries, roughly half of whom are fighters. Syria has been devastated by a 12-year-long civil war that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad's government responded with deadly force to peaceful pro-democracy protests. The fighting has left half a million people dead and caused half the population to flee their homes, including almost six million refugees abroad. More than 15 million people inside Syria require humanitarian assistance, including close to 9 million affected by the huge earthquake that struck neighbouring Turkey in February.",

      "title": "Turkish elections: Erdogan kicks off race to hold on to power",
      "text": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has launched his ruling party's bid to stay in power, as he seeks to extend his leadership of Turkey beyond 20 years. He is facing his stiffest challenge yet from six opposition parties who have combined forces for presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May. Turkey faces soaring inflation and is reeling from twin earthquakes that have left 50,000 people dead. Mr Erdogan and his ruling AK Party say they will bring inflation down to single figures, a commitment already made by their opponents. Turkey has become increasingly authoritarian under President Erdogan and the opposition is seeking to reverse that. Any candidate that can secure more than half the presidential vote on 14 May is the outright winner. Failing that, the race goes to a run-off two weeks later. Whichever party wins the parliamentary vote is seen as having a psychological advantage if the presidential election goes to a second round. Turkey's voters have been polarised for years, but Mr Erdogan, 69, is under pressure as never before. Turkey has become increasingly authoritarian under its current leader, who runs Turkey from a vast palace with much of the media controlled by his allies. He has ruled Turkey since 2003, initially as prime minister but then as president since 2014, dramatically increasing his powers three years later after a failed 2016 coup. His AK Party has been in power since November 2002. Increasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for soaring inflation, because of his unorthodox refusal to raise interest rates. The official inflation rate is just above 50%, but academics say it is actually higher than 100%. Turkey's president and ruling party have also been widely criticised for failing to adapt Turkey's construction practices before the 6 February earthquakes and for mishandling the search and rescue efforts afterwards. Millions of Turks were left homeless in the 11 provinces affected by the quakes. Since many of them are seen as Erdogan party strongholds, the election could be won and lost in the east. His AK Party is rooted in political Islam, but he has forged an alliance with the ultra-nationalist MHP. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, 74, comes across as a mild-mannered, bookish opponent and he has presided over a string of election defeats at the helm of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). But this time could be different as he is fighting as a unity candidate for six opposition parties, ranging from his own centre-left party and the nationalist Good party to four smaller groups, which include two former Erdogan allies one of whom co-founded the AK Party. Mr Kilicdaroglu also has the unofficial backing of Turkey's pro-Kurdish HDP, which is running for parliament under the banner of another party, the Green Left, because of a court case alleging links to Kurdish militants. His selection was not universally popular, because some considered the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara as better candidates after they took control of the cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994. A former civil servant who is part of the Alevi minority, Mr Kilicdaroglu led a 24-day march for justice in 2017 which was seen as the biggest show of defiance against President Erdogan's rule for years. His Nation's Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament. To change the system, they need to win 400 of Turkey's 600 MPs, or 360 MPs to take a proposal to a referendum. The leaders of the other five members of the alliance have agreed to take on the roles of vice-president. Turkish opinion polls are notoriously unreliable, but any chance Mr Kilicdaroglu had of winning the election outright in the first round appears to have been dashed by the decision of a former centre-left party colleague, Muharrem Ince, to join the presidential race. Mr Ince, 58, was the Republican People's Party presidential candidate in 2018, but left two years later because of differences with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, He now runs the secular nationalist Homeland Party and has faced accusations of diluting the opposition vote and playing into President Erdogan's hands. But he has a strong presence on social media and young voters in particular have been impressed by his dance moves on TikTok. One other candidate with little chance of significant success is ultra-nationalist Sinan Ogan, but he too has the potential to be a kingmaker. To enter the 600-seat parliament, a party needs to attract 7% of the vote or be part of an alliance that does. That is why alliances have become so important in Turkey, and the six-party opposition have highlighted changing that as one of their proposed reforms. Turks vote for party lists rather than candidates under proportional representation, so seat numbers correspond to votes cast per party rather than alliances. In some seats, the opposition has agreed to fight under one party banner. Candidates running for the Green Left instead of the pro-Kurdish party are part of the Labour and Freedom Alliance. Under the Erdogan reforms, it is now the president who chooses the government, so there is no prime minister. And if his broad People's Alliance fails to win a majority in parliament, he may struggle to rule in the same way as now. The pro-Erdogan People's Alliance currently has 334 MPs. Mr Erdogan has already served two terms as president, so a third appears to go against the rules of Turkey's constitution. But Turkey's YSK election board ruled that his first term should be seen as starting not in 2014 but in 2018, when the new presidential system began with elections for parliament and president on the same day. Opposition politicians had earlier asked the YSK to block his candidacy. The Kilicdaroglu-led Nation's Alliance alliance wants to restore Turkey's parliamentary system and reform the presidency, removing the head of state's right to veto legislation, cutting the post's ties to political parties and making it electable every seven years. The six parties also want to kickstart Turkey's decades-long bid to join the European Union and restore \"mutual trust\" with the US, after years of fractious relations during the Erdogan years. They have pledged to bring inflation below 10% within two years and send Syrian refugees home voluntarily. Turkey currently hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees.",

      "title": "The 70s nuclear relic that may be about to open at last",
      "text": "A cool breeze blows off the West Manila Bay into a grove of mango trees some 100km west of the Philippine capital. In the sky above, a family of Pacific swallows are busy doing acrobatics. Sitting rather incongruously in this bucolic scene is the vast concrete hulk of the Bataan nuclear power plant. This is South East Asia's first nuclear power plant, which was completed in 1986. Except it has never produced a kilowatt of electricity. It was never even put into operation. Now, more than three decades after it was finished, there is growing support for opening it. A rising energy bill and the ever-present threat of climate change is once again turning the tide in favour of nuclear power across the world. So why not in the Philippines, a developing economy where electricity is essential but expensive and often dirty? But the real question is: how easy is it to start up a 38-year-old nuclear power plant that has never been used? The early morning calm outside the Bataan nuclear power plant is broken by the whop-whop of an approaching helicopter. Minutes later, Congressman Mark Cojuangco leads the way into the plant. Passing through a semi-lit machinery room, he points to the maze of piping and electrical conduits: \"Look at the quality of that wiring. Look how neatly it is laid out.\" He walks down a long corridor, and through an airlock into the main reactor building. The walls are 1.5m-thick concrete; the whole containment structure is lined by a 30mm-thick welded steel liner. \"Please feel the welds,\" he says, patting the walls. \"I challenge you to find welding as nice as this anywhere in the Philippines. In the US they are required to do X-ray inspection of 20% of the welds [in a nuclear plant]. Here it was 100%, so arguably this building is better quality than in the United States.\" For more than a decade Mr Cojuangco has been waging an uphill battle to open the plant. It is an ambitious, some would even say outlandish, idea. \"I don't think there's any way they can get that thing going,\" a foreign diplomat said at the mention of the Bataan nuclear plant. \"That looks like an accident waiting to happen!\" was another response upon seeing a photo of the plant. So, who would want to take this on? The answer is President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr. For President Marcos Jr the plant is unfinished family business. It represents what might have been if his father hadn't been ousted from power. In the mid-1970s, with the world's economy reeling from the 1973 oil price shock, President Ferdinand Marcos Sr decided to bring nuclear power to the Philippines. It would have put the country alongside Japan and South Korea as a pioneer of nuclear energy in Asia. Marcos Sr commissioned the US company Westinghouse to build two pressurised water reactors on the Bataan peninsula, on the far side of Manila Bay. By the end of 1985 the first reactor was complete and ready to be loaded with nuclear fuel. But in February the following year Marcos Sr was forced from power as two million protesters took to the streets of Manila, demanding an end to his dictatorship. Just eight weeks later reports began to emerge of a terrible accident at a nuclear power plant in the then Soviet Union. A new word entered the global vernacular: Chernobyl. Plans to load fuel into the Bataan plant were put on hold indefinitely. Inside the plant, the main control room looks shockingly old and outdated, almost like a museum. The wall panels are filled with dozens of ancient-looking analogue dials. Below them, the control panels are a forest of black mechanical switches. Mr Cojuangco waves away these objections: \"People always use the analogy of cars or motorcycles. But the mode of ageing of a nuclear reactor is from neutron bombardment. So far, this reactor has had none, so effectively it's brand new.\" He doesn't deny that the systems in the plant will need plenty of work, and that it will cost time and money. He says South Korean nuclear operator KEPCO, which runs an identical nuclear plant in Busan, has offered to bring the one in Bataan up to date for around $1.5bn (£915m). The plant's lone reactor - a planned second one was never built - can produce up to 620 megawatts of power, about half the capacity of its more modern counterparts. Mr Cojuangco repeatedly points out that Bataan would not be the first old, mothballed nuclear plant to be put into operation. It's been done before - in Tennessee. Work on Watts Bar Two, as the plant is known, began in 1973, even before Bataan. But then it was mothballed for decades, says Mr Cojuangco, before they decided to finish construction in 2009. \"In 2016, it became America's newest nuclear plant. If it's ok there, then why not here?\" he asks. For President Marcos Jr this might well be the best opportunity to revive his father's dream. The war in Ukraine has set off another energy price shock across the globe, and the Philippines is being hit hard. At the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, Dr Carlos Arcilla points to a pie chart that breaks down the country's energy sources. \"You can see 50% is from coal, and 90% of that coal is imported from Indonesia,\" he says. The Philippines has one small natural gas field of its own, but that is running out. Electricity prices have doubled in the last 12 months as the country becomes more dependent than ever on imported fossil fuel. \"The average Filipino already pays 10% of take-home pay on electricity,\" Dr Arcilla says, adding that prices will go higher. The impact is greatest among the poorest. You don't have to walk far in Metro Manila to find poor neighbourhoods, or barangay as they are known. All over the city vacant land is taken over and turned into squatter settlements, where homes are made from scrap wood and corrugated iron. In one barangay not far from Dr Arcilla's office lives Marilou Calica, a 47-year-old mother of six, who works as a part-time cleaner in a government office. The fatigue is written on her face. \"I haven't paid my electricity bill for the last three months,\" she says. \"After I have bought food there is nothing left.\" She pulls out a sheet of printed paper - a final notice from the electricity company. Her outstanding bill: 5,000 pesos (about $100; $75). She says it's double what she paid a year ago. \"If I don't pay this week, they will cut me off. I may be forced to go to the money lender.\" Despite the struggles of poor Filipinos, the move to reopen the Bataan plant - and eventually lower the country's energy bill - faces stiff opposition. Anti-nuclear groups say re-commissioning the plant will take years and do nothing to help people like Ms Calica. Instead, they say the government should be investing in local solar and wind projects that are cheaper and much quicker to build. \"If they get it running, by 2040 it will contribute only 2.5% of the power in the Philippines, so why do they really want to do it?\" says Derek Cabe, who leads the Nuclear Free Bataan Movement. She says her parents' generation fought to stop the plant in the 1980s and she is ready to do the same now. \"We cannot let the monster live again,\" she says. \"We call it the sleeping monster and we cannot let the monster be awakened.\" Those who oppose the plant draw comparisons between the Philippines and Japan, and between the Bataan plant and the one in Fukushima, which was destroyed in the 2011 tsunami. Both countries sit on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. The Philippines has two dozen active volcanoes, and is regularly hit by earthquakes and is also vulnerable to tsunamis. But Mr Cojuangco, who has been to Fukushima and studied the disaster there, is not worried. \"Before the incident in Fukushima I had no basis for saying that if we had a 9.0 earthquake here, we would sail through it. But now I have the evidence. The plant here is 18 metres above sea level. With a same-sized tsunami as Fukushima the plant would not even get wet. If this plant had been at Fukushima, there would be no incident to talk about.\" Around 60% of Filipinos now say they support the country building nuclear power. And there appears to be no scientific reason to stop this relic from the 1970s from producing electricity one day. Its biggest obstacle is politics. In the Philippines, a president can only serve a single six-year term. And for Mr Cojuangco the moment is now because after 37 years, history has come full circle. \"In the 1980s we wanted to be independent of fossil fuels,\" he says, \"Now in 2023 we have an energy crisis again, and there is another Marcos president in the Malacañang palace.\"",

      "text": "A landslide has buried entire families under mud and rubble in a mountain village in Ecuador. Firefighters, police and specialised rescue teams have been dispatched to the canton of Alausí, in the Andes mountains, to search for trapped residents. Six people have been pulled alive from the mud but many more are feared buried under the rubble of their houses. It is not yet clear how many people may still be missing. Local media said that residents had been warning of fault lines forming in the area. Just days ago, the highway linking Alausí with Guamote was closed indefinitely after the tarmac had cracked open. One resident told local media that \"the mountainside slid down like a rocket\" on Sunday evening, burying several homes under earth and rocks. A video uploaded by the police showed people using torches and spotlights to search for survivors amid the surrounding darkness. Local radio reporters described \"heart-wrenching scenes\" as relatives rushed to the site looking for their loved ones. President Guillermo Lasso said the country's risk management agency had been alerted and would be providing help to those affected. One of the main roads linking the cities of Riobamba and Cuenca had to be closed due to these latest landslides, further complicating access to the area. The landslide comes just over a week after an earthquake struck Ecuador's southern coast, leaving more than a dozen people dead.",

      "title": "Turkish earthquake: Survivors' haunting search for missing relatives",
      "text": "It has been seven weeks since two huge earthquakes hit Turkey and northern Syria, and Orhan Kosker has not stopped searching for his nephews. Ismet and Sirac, aged 13 and nine, were asleep in their home in the south-eastern Turkish city of Gaziantep. Their mother, father and sister were all killed in the quake. Their bodies were found nine days later, and removed from the rubble. But there was no trace of the two boys. Gaziantep was one of 11 Turkish cities that suffered widespread destruction on 6 February. In Turkey alone 50,000 people have died. Almost 6,000 more lives were lost in northern and western areas of Syria. For Turkey, the financial cost is estimated at more than $100bn (£81bn). While mammoth efforts are being made to give quake victims some form of normality, there are still hundreds of families searching for their missing loved ones, hoping to find them either dead or alive. Eyewitnesses told Orhan that his nephews' building collapsed after a minute or two, and that many people had managed to escape. He was convinced the boys could have survived too. Since the earthquakes, nearly 2,000 unaccompanied children have been rescued from under the rubble and registered with the authorities, according to official figures provided by the Ministry of Family and Social Affairs. Almost 200 of them are yet to be identified and reunited with their relatives. Turkey's health ministry has set up a helpline for quake victims and relatives of the missing. Orhan said he called the helpline every day to check the list of recently identified children in case his nephews are on it. His family has also handed over DNA samples. \"We want to find our children even if they're dead. Even if it's just their bones we find, we will carry on searching. May God help us,\" he said. There is no official figure for the number of missing people across Turkey following the earthquakes. But it is believed that at least 1,400 bodies are yet to be identified. For Abdulkudus Kazan, the search for her sister Hicran has been overwhelming. Hicran Karadag, 44, was rescued from under the wreckage of her apartment within hours of the earthquake. She was taken to hospital by ambulance, but for the next month her family were unable to find out whether she was alive or dead. They searched for her across dozens of cities. Finally they received a tip-off that almost 1,000 victims of the quakes had been buried at a cemetery in Narlica, just outside the city of Antakya. Abdulkudus travelled to the newly built site, a mass grave of the missing victims. Before unidentified bodies were buried at the cemetery, Turkish authorities had taken photographs, collected DNA samples and taken fingerprints. Each unidentified victim had a number on their grave. Abdulkudus went through some 1,500 photographs in search of his sister. She even opened body bags and checking corpses to see if Hicran was there. It was with tears of relief as much as sorrow that she learned that a DNA sample taken at the site matched a body that had been buried at the cemetery. The death certificate showed that Hicran had lost her life as a result of cardiovascular arrest due to body and head trauma. It was not clear whether or not she had received any treatment at the hospital. However, the certificate mentioned that her body had been left out in the open in a carpark at the field hospital for two days. She was then buried without proper identification. \"It is very difficult to search for your missing relative,\" said her sister. \"You don't know whether they are dead or alive, so you always have hope. \"Even when the officials told me the DNA samples matched, I was still hoping they might be wrong, that my sister could be alive. Now I'm just relieved that she has a grave of her own.\"",

      "title": "Immigration fuels Canada's largest population growth of over 1 million",
      "text": "Canada's population grew by over a million people for the first time ever in 2022, the government said on Wednesday. The country's population increased from 38,516,138 on 1 January, 2022 to 39,566,248 people on 1 January 2023, Statistics Canada said. It also marked Canada's highest annual population growth rate - 2.7% - since 1957. Migration accounted for nearly 96% of the population growth, the agency said. The increase was in part fuelled by government efforts to recruit migrants to the country to ease labour shortages, Statistics Canada said. But the surge in the number of permanent and temporary immigrants could \"also represent additional challenges for some regions of the country related to housing, infrastructure and transportation, and service delivery to the population\", the government said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made efforts to attract more immigrants to the country to fill a gap in its economy due to aging Baby Boomers. Last year, the government announced a plan to welcome 500,000 immigrants a year by 2025. The Canadian government has also been accepting people affected by conflicts like the Ukraine war, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. The country welcomed 437,000 immigrants in 2022, while the number of non-permanent residents in the country increased by 607,782, accounting for a \"record-breaking year for the processing of immigration applications\", according to the agency. The population increase also means Canada would rank first among the 38 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation for 2022 population growth, while it was also the fastest growing G7 country, Statistics Canada said. If Canada were to maintain the 2.7% increase each year, its population would double in 26 years, the Canadian government said.",

      "title": "At least 12 dead after earthquake hits Pakistan and Afghanistan",
      "text": "At least 12 people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a powerful earthquake struck large parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The 6.5-magnitude quake damaged buildings, triggered landslides and sent people running into the streets. It hit Tuesday evening local time and was centred in Afghanistan's Jurm valley which is prone to quakes. The remoteness of the sparsely populated area is likely to slow relief and rescue work. \"It was a terrifying tremor. I had never felt such a tremor before in my life,\" Kabul resident Khatera told AFP news agwncy after rushing out of her fifth-storey apartment. Nine of the confirmed fatalities were reported in the valley region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Three others were killed in Afghanistan, the country's health ministry spokesman said. A child was among those fatalities in the Laghman province near the country's border with Pakistan, AFP reported. Many families were out of their homes celebrating the Persian New Year or Norwuz when the quake struck. In neighbouring Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has asked disaster agencies to take emergency measures to help people. Tremors were felt over a 1,000-km area that spans India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre. Earthquakes are more likely in this region because it lies at the juncture of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. In June last year more than 1,000 people were killed after a 5.9-magnitude quake struck Afghanistan's Paktika province, the country's deadliest in nearly a quarter of a century.

      "title": "Southern Ecuador earthquake kills at least 12",
      "text": "At least 12 people have died after a powerful earthquake struck the southern coast of Ecuador. Buildings have been damaged in several cities following the 6.7 magnitude quake, which hit at around midday local time (17:00 GMT). The southern province of El Oro was the worst affected, where emergency services have reported people remain trapped inside collapsed houses. Eleven deaths were in El Oro and one in Azuay province, authorities said. Machala and Cuenca were among the cities that suffered damage to buildings and vehicles, as emergency services rushed to help people. The epicentre was near Balao, about 50 miles (80km) from Ecuador's second-largest city, Guayaquil, where about three million people live. \"I went out into the street because I saw people starting to run in panic, getting out of their cars,\" Magaly Escandon, a businessowner in Cuenca, told the AFP news agency. President Guillermo Lasso asked Ecuadoreans to remain calm as officials assess the damage. \"Emergency teams are mobilising to offer all their support to those who have been affected,\" he said. Mr Lasso's office also confirmed that injured people were being treated in hospital, but did not offer any further details. Several roads have been blocked by landslides, while several homes, educational buildings and health centres have been damaged, authorities said. One person was reported killed in the city of Cuenca after a wall collapsed onto their car, while three people died when a security camera tower came down on Jambelí Island. There have also been reports of the earthquake being felt in several other cities, including Manabi, Manta and the capital Quito. This is the strongest quake to hit Ecuador since 2016, when nearly 700 people died and thousands were injured. Officials in Peru say the quake was felt in northern regions of the country, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.",

      "title": "Cyclone Gabrielle: The New Zealand flood victims too scared to go home",
      "text": "Last month, Cyclone Gabrielle smashed into New Zealand's North Island - killing 11 people and displacing at least 10,000 more. It's triggered a national debate about climate change and whether vulnerable homes should be rebuilt or written off. \"I don't want to go back there,\" said Amy Bowkett. The mother of two lived in the Hawkes Bay area, one of the regions worst hit by Cyclone Gabrielle. When the Category 3 storm hit with wind speeds of up to 159km/h (99mph), her home was completely destroyed. Along with 50 of her neighbours she spent a terrifying 48 hours trapped without power, water or phone signal.   Eventually she was able to make a call and a friend organised a helicopter rescue from a neighbour's backyard.     \"I feel like if we get flooded a third time, it would be our fault,\" she told the BBC from her mother's home in the nearby city of Napier. \"Unless we put our house on stilts, I'd be terrified every time it rained.\" She's not alone in fearing to return. Many of the victims of New Zealand's recent floods lost all of their possessions in the disaster and believe the area their homes are built on has become too dangerous for them to go back.   The damage caused by the cyclone is forecast to cost NZD$13.5bn ($8.4bn; £6.9bn), similar to the financial impact of the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 - the costliest natural disaster in New Zealand's history.  Last month's event prompted a nationwide state of emergency that only ended on Tuesday. Cyclone Gabrielle also struck within weeks of unprecedented flooding in New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland, when an entire summer's worth of rain fell in a single day. New Zealand's climate change minister, James Shaw, attributed the scale of the disaster to climate change, exacerbated by global temperature increases. \"There will be people who say it's too soon to talk about these things… but we are standing in it right now. This is a climate change-related event,\" he said in a speech to parliament last month. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Shaw said that while many homeowners have taken out a \"total replacement\" insurance policy, which compensates them if their house is destroyed or made uninhabitable, it only covers the cost of the property - not the value of the land it's built on. This means people feel \"they have to rebuild on the current land and of course, they're really frightened\", he added. The country is likely to experience more extreme rainfall events and regional cyclones are likely to become more frequent by 2100, according to New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. During warm months days are already hotter, drier and windier, increasing the risk of bushfires. Some 55,000 homes in Auckland are prone to flooding, according to government data. Another 76,000 homes across the country are in coastal areas, vulnerable to erosion and sea level rise. \"[When] people are sleeping with lifejackets by the door, you know it's bad,\" said displaced West Auckland resident Morgan Allen. \"The anxiety has reached peak levels.\" Alongside a group of dozens of Auckland flood victims, Morgan has launched a campaign calling on the government to buy out their homes and turn the high-risk areas into parks or nature reserves. The audio engineer says some of his neighbours spent a year rebuilding their homes only to lose everything again in January.   Morgan blames climate change for recent events, but also tightly packed housing developments - where rows of homes have been built on concrete, replacing single homes on grass areas. \"Our city has lost a huge amount of capacity to sponge up all of this water.\" He said this had increased the flood risk for homes built near valleys and wetlands. Consequently, in the days after the cyclone and the Auckland floods, the government announced a NZD$300m ($185m) package for affected regions. It also introduced new Severe Weather Emergency legislation, designed to help rural landowners fix their properties and rebuild, without the usual red tape. The impact for the food-growing regions of New Zealand has also been significant. In just one sector, half of the Kumara crop, a type of sweet potato found in New Zealand, was wiped out. Just down the road from Amy Bowkett in the small rural community of Puketapu were two orchards owned by Brydon Nisbet, blooming with apple trees ready to harvest. When the cyclone hit, the infrastructure designed to stop the main rivers from flooding collapsed, completely burying his orchard in mud and potentially toxic silt. \"It was just a disaster zone and pretty shocking really,\" said Brydon, who couldn't reach his property until three days after the disaster. \"Everything was ruined. The water went up around three to four metres in the house.\" Brydon, who represents fruit growers in Hawkes Bay, estimates up to half of the region's fruit orchards have been hit, some of them totally wiped out. Farmers are desperate to salvage what they can. \"We're all pretty resilient. I've still had plenty of cries and hugs with my wife and different people. But we need to remain positive and have hope. \"When we made the decision to try and save this orchard, that actually brought hope,\" he said. \"We thought, we want these trees to bloom again, we don't want them to die.\"",

His funeral is being held outside State House in Ghana's capital, Accra. \"In life I love you darling, in death I'll do the same,\" read the tearful tribute from the footballer's widow, Marie-Claire Rupio. She was overcome with emotion and handed her speech to Atsu's sister to finish reading. \"You did not go alone, for part of me went with you,\" it continued. \"Your smile, your love I see in our children's smiles.\" Representatives of Ghana's national team and Atsu's Turkish club Hatayspor were also at the ceremony for a man seen by many as a national hero. \"Even at the peak of his career, Astu remained himself and was never overtaken by pride, arrogance or indiscipline,\" Sport Minister Mustapha Ussif told mourners. \"His legacy will remain as an inspiration.\" Atsu's body was recovered a fortnight after the quake from the rubble of his apartment building. It was returned to Ghana almost a month ago. He will be buried later in his home village in south-eastern Ghana. Atsu, 31, spent most of his career playing in the English Premier League for clubs including Chelsea, Newcastle and Everton. He also made 65 appearances for Ghana, and helped the national side reach the finals of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea - where he was awarded goal and player of the tournament. Many Ghanaians have told the BBC that Atsu will be remembered for his love for humanity, and for supporting the underprivileged in the country. Hundreds of mourners and well-wishers filed past Atsu's body on Tuesday to say their farewells. Drumming and brass bands have been part of the colourful cultural display at an otherwise solemn event.",

      "text": "A farmers' party has stunned Dutch politics, and is set to be the biggest party in the upper house of parliament after provincial elections. The Farmer-citizen movement (BBB) was only set up in 2019 in the wake of widespread farmers' protests. But with most votes counted they are due to win 15 seats of the Senate's seats with almost 20% of the vote. \"This isn't normal, but actually it is! It's all normal citizens who voted,\" said leader Caroline van der Plas. The BBB aims to fight government plans to slash nitrogen emissions by dramatically reducing livestock numbers and buying out thousands of farms. But its appeal has spread rapidly beyond farmers, on a populist platform that represents traditional, conservative Dutch social and moral values. Shocked by the scale of their success, she told supporters that voters normally stayed at home if they lost faith in politics: \"But today people have shown they can't stay at home any longer. We won't be ignored any more.\" A left-wing Green-Labour alliance is also on course to win 15 Senate seats, while Prime Minister Mark Rutte's four-party coalition is poised to fall back to 24 - down eight seats. The run-up to the vote was dominated by the sight of farmers' tractors on the streets of The Hague and outside the studio that hosted a pre-vote leaders' debate. Standing before supporters on Wednesday night, Caroline van der Plas wore her trademark green nail polish and a ring featuring an upside-down Dutch flag, a symbol of the anti-government protests. The daughter of an Irish mother and a Dutch father, she lost her husband Jan to pancreatic cancer as the protests took off in 2019. Commentator Ben Coates described the result as \"something of an earthquake in Dutch politics\". Although their policies are very much focused on opposing the government's environmental policies, he told the BBC most people would characterise them as a right-wing, populist party that was quite anti-EU, anti-immigration and in favour of banning burkas for Muslims.",

      "text": "Fourteen people have died and several others are missing after floods swept through the streets of two cities in south-east Turkey devastated by last month's earthquakes. Among the victims were quake survivors who had been living in container homes since the quakes. Cars tumbled on a torrent of floodwater through the streets of Sanliurfa, where 12 people died. A container housing two families in Adiyaman was caught up in the floods. A woman living in the container was among two people killed in the city. Several others were reported missing. Tents in the city were evacuated. The latest disaster came only five weeks after the twin earthquakes on 6 February in which 48,000 people were killed and many more left homeless. Search and rescue organisation Afad said that in one 24-hour period, 136mm (5.4in) of rain had fallen in one area of Adiyaman province and 111mm (4.4in) in Sanliurfa, which saw a third of its annual rainfall in the past two days. The governor of Sanliurfa, Salih Ayhan, said his province had never seen flooding like it and officials appealed to residents to evacuate the ground floor and basements of homes. The bodies of five people were found in a basement apartment and Turkish media said they were Syrians. Bodies were also recovered from an underpass at the major Abide road junction. Several people were dragged off in their vehicles by the current of the floodwaters and people who tried to help those stranded were themselves swept away. Dramatic footage emerged of a man being pulled out of the torrent in Sanliurfa by a local dangling a rope from a ground-floor window. A similar rescue took place at the Abide junction. Two of the missing were firefighters, said the governor, who appealed to residents to keep well away from the moving water. A hospital was flooded and 200 patients moved elsewhere. The rain is due to die down towards the end of the week. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is grappling with the aftermath of last month's earthquake, is facing elections on 14 May. He has sent the interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, to the flood region. Leading opposition figures are also due to visit Sanliurfa, and have vowed to help meet the urgent needs of residents.",

      "text": "A celebrity gossip YouTuber turned MP will become Japan's first lawmaker to be kicked out of parliament without ever actually entering it. Yoshikazu Higashitani was expelled on Tuesday by his Senate colleagues for never coming to work. He has not attended a single day of parliament sessions since being elected to office seven months ago. The parliament's discipline committee stripped him of his status because of the continued absence. Voters had elected Mr Higashitani to the upper house last July. He is better known as GaaSyy on YouTube where he is famous for his celebrity gossip videos. Expulsion is the most severe punishment a lawmaker can receive. It has happened only two times since 1950 and this is the first time an MP has been expelled due to continued absence. The chamber is set to formalise the decision later this week. The lawmaker - who has been nicknamed 'No-show MP'- is believed to be living in the United Arab Emirates. He has so far refused to attend parliament because he fears being arrested over fraud allegations, and defamation claims from celebrities, Japanese media reported. He is one of two members elected from the Seijika-joshi-48 opposition party. The single-issue party - formerly known as the NHK Party - only calls for reforms to Japan's public broadcaster. The party regularly changes its name for publicity reasons, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has reported. Last week, parliament had demanded Mr Higashitani fly to Tokyo to deliver an in-person apology in the chamber for his absence. Lawmakers had said this would be a last chance for redemption. But Mr Higashitani failed to show up at the plenary session. Instead, he announced on his YouTube channel that he was going to Turkey - and that he was planning to donate his salary to the Turkish earthquake relief. His absence angered the Senate - whose members voted for his expulsion this week. His sole other party colleague, Hamada Satoshi, argued that it was illegal to expel Mr Higashitani because of his absence from sessions. However the committee voted unanimously to expel him.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: UK team to assess building damage",
      "text": "Structural and civil engineers from the UK have travelled to Turkey to help to investigate the damage caused by last month's powerful earthquake. They are collecting geological data and carrying out detailed assessments of why so many buildings collapsed. Work with their Turkish colleagues has revealed examples of poor construction, including large pebbles mixed in concrete, which weakens its strength. But the sheer power of the quake also caused some of the devastation. The ground movement was so great in some areas that it exceeded what buildings had been designed to withstand. Turkey is also carrying out its own extensive investigations into the quake. The research is being carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT). The group includes experts from industry as well as leading academics and has carried out assessments of major earthquakes over the last three decades. They will combine their findings with research being carried out by Turkish teams and other structural engineers with the aim of learning lessons from the earthquake and finding ways to improve the construction of buildings to make them more resilient. \"It's important to get the full picture rather than just looking at a snapshot of a single asset or a single building,\" explains Professor Emily So, director of the Cambridge University Centre for Risk in the Built Environment, who is co-leader of the investigation. \"The successes of the buildings that are still intact and perform perfectly well are as important as the neighbouring buildings that have collapsed. \"And actually having that distribution, having that overview, is really key to what we can learn from this earthquake.\" The Magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck on 6 February in southern Turkey close to the Syrian border and was followed by powerful aftershocks. More than 50,000 people lost their lives in the region as buildings collapsed. In the wake of the devastation, there has been scrutiny of building regulations and construction practices in Turkey. Now the EEFIT team is carrying out technical evaluations of the performance of buildings in the area. Structural engineers from Turkey, who are working with the team, have already found some problems. Samples of concrete taken from a collapsed building in Adiyaman have revealed that it contains 6cm-long stones. They have come from a nearby river and have been used to bulk out the concrete. \"That has some serious implications on the strength of the concrete,\" says Prof So. And steel bars inside the concrete, which should reinforce it, have been found to be smooth instead of ridged. This means the concrete doesn't cling to them, again weakening the structure. In Turkey, many older buildings collapsed during the quake, but some modern ones also failed. New building codes were brought in after a major earthquake in Iznit in 1999, and Prof So says newer buildings should have fared better. \"I think it's really important that we recognise those and actually do the testing, to find out why these new buildings, which would have been built to code, have failed in such a way,\" she told BBC News. The EEFIT team is also analysing the nature of the quake. Dr Yasemin Didem Aktas, co-leader of the expedition, from UCL in London, said that the earthquake was extremely powerful. \"Even the aftershocks were as large in magnitude as a decent-sized earthquake,\" she said. The quake also caused major ground shifts. \"In an earthquake, the ground shakes in a horizontal and vertical fashion. Often the vertical component is much lower and negligible compared to the horizontal movement. However, this event recorded very high vertical accelerations as well.\" Some areas saw a process called liquefaction. It turns the solid ground into a heavy fluid - like very wet sand - a tell-tale sign of this is a building that has toppled over or has sunk. \"I think the characteristics of the events also played a very important role in the devastation that we are seeing,\" Dr Aktas added. But buildings can be designed to be earthquake resilient. Ziggy Lubkowski, who leads the seismic team at design and engineering company Arup, which has sent engineers to Turkey for the investigation, said: \"What we try and do when we design buildings is to prevent life loss. \"The basic design principle is to allow some form of damage within the building. That damage absorbs the energy of the earthquake, and ensures that the building still stays upright, but doesn't collapse.\" Components such as dampers, which act like shock absorbers as the building sways to and fro, and rubber bearings, which are fitted underneath a building and absorb the energy of a quake, can be added. But all of this costs money. \"Those increases, in terms of the structural cost of the building, may be in the order of 10 to 15%, depending on the nature of the building,\" Ziggy Lubkowski says. \"But actually, if you think about it, the fit-out costs of a building often outweigh the structural costs of a building. So at the end of the day, the additional structural costs are not that much more.\" The United Nations has estimated that the cost of clearing and rebuilding in the earthquake in Turkey could exceed $100 billion. The EEFIT team says the findings, which will be published in the coming weeks, could help in setting new building codes to stop the devastation caused by this earthquake from happening again, Follow Rebecca on Twitter.",

      "title": "Is India-China infrastructure race damaging Himalayas?",
      "text": "With fresh cracks appearing on the ground, the Himalayan town of Joshimath in northern India continues to make headlines. Why the town is sinking remains a subject of debate. But scientists say there is a bigger disturbing picture unfolding in the Himalayas. They say the pace at which China and India are building infrastructure across the Himalayan region can significantly increase hazards and risks of natural disasters. Global warming is further destabilising the ecologically fragile region as rising temperatures continue to melt glaciers and permafrost (permanently frozen land). And this is where highways are being carved, railway tracks are being laid, tunnels are being drilled, dams and airstrips are being built on both the sides of the Himalayas. \"So, basically you are bringing yourself closer and closer to the hazards\" said Andreas Kaab, professor of physical geography and hydrology at Oslo University, who co-authored a major report on the cause of a devastating avalanche in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand state in 2021. Studies have focused on individual events but when they are pieced together, they show increasing risks of hazards across the region - 3,500km (2,174 miles) of which China and India share as their de facto border, called the Line of Actual Control (LAC). There was one partial or fully road-blocking landslide on every kilometre along the NH-7 national highway in Uttarakhand during September and October 2022, a study published in the Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences said. Other studies have also pointed at similar hazards. \"In addition to the environmental conditions, road construction and widening have contributed to the formation of new landslides which are often shallow and small, but which nevertheless inflict fatalities, [cause] severe damages to infrastructure and traffic disruption,\" a study published by European Geosciences Union said. Landslides and other natural disasters have increasingly become common in recent years. The newly built Char Dham highway in Uttarakhand has also seen parts of it collapse during the monsoon rains last year. More than 200 people were killed and two under-construction hydropower stations were severely damaged during the Chamoli avalanche. While preparing a report on the incident, India's National Disaster Management Authority found that officials in the district had not factored in climate and infrastructure related risks while making plans to deal with future disasters. India's ministry of environment, forests and climate change did not respond to our questions about infrastructure projects posing threats to the Himalayan region. Experts say the risk of natural disasters is equally high on the Chinese side of the Himalayas. Thawing of permafrost is posing immense threat to the infrastructure built in the region. A study published in Communications Earth and Environment journal in October found that nearly 9,400km of road, 580km of railways, more than 2,600km of power lines and thousands of buildings in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau are in permafrost area. \"By 2050, 38.14% of roads, 38.76% of railways, 39.41% of power lines and 20.94% of buildings may be threatened by permafrost degradation in high-hazard areas,\" it said. In eastern Tibet, to the north of India's Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim states, the terrain becomes difficult. The risk of rivers bursting out from their natural path remains high. \"The region has experienced a series of high-magnitude ice-rock avalanches, glacier detachments and glacial lake outburst floods in recent decades,\" a report published last year in The Cryosphere journal said. Earlier this month, 28 people died after a massive avalanche hit the exit of a tunnel in the Medog county in Tibet. In 2000, a huge landslide destroyed all bridges, roads and telecommunications facilities built over the previous decades in Bomi country in the same part of Tibet. \"The region is the focus of considerable investment by the Chinese government, including construction of the high-speed Sichuan-Tibet railway,\" said the report published in The Cryosphere. Chinese officials say the railway will go over 21 snow-capped mountains more than 4,000m (13,000ft) above sea level) and cross 14 major rivers. \"In addition to the rugged terrain, the railway will face other hazards such as avalanches, landslides and earthquakes,\" You Yong, chief engineer of the institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua News Agency. Experts say increasing settlements in places like Nyingchi and Shigatse have also meant significant increase in development of infrastructure, including roads and telecommunications. \"They have built 624 new border settlements,\" says Robbie Barnett, professorial research associate with School of Oriental and African Studies in London, citing Chinese media reports. \"Each of these has to have extensive infrastructural components including roads, power supplies, water supplies and so forth. \"Many are at extraordinarily high altitude, over 4,000m, where there has never been human settlement that we know of, and where human settlement would seem impractical if not impossible, without extensive construction, supplies, inputs and so forth.\" China's ministry of ecology and environment could not be reached for comments. To the south of the Chinese areas that have seen new settlements, on the Indian side are states like Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim where construction of hydropower projects is going ahead full steam. But these are also the states that have been identified by the Central Water Commission of India as the ones that have seen significant expansion of glacial lakes and water bodies between 2009 and 2020, mainly because of melting glaciers. A study published by American Geophysical Union in 2020 found that of the 23 critical glacial lakes in India, 17 were in Sikkim. Such lakes are categorised as critical when they have filled up because of melting glaciers and are at risk of bursting. China and India have always worked together during international climate talks to protect their interest, often countering the West. Experts say such partnership is not as effective when it comes to dealing with the challenges of climate change or other environmental degradation in the Himalayas. Instead, experts say, geopolitical competition and hostility has driven both the Asian giants to ramp up all kinds of development activities, including military ones, in this hazard-prone zone. \"This should have been an international biosphere reserve where no disturbance should have been allowed,\" says Jeffrey Kargel, an American geoscientist who has done many studies on the Himalayas. \"But what we see today in the Himalayas is rising risks of hazards, growing exposure to such hazards, and as a result increasing vulnerability in the region. \"We are going to see many many disasters here.\" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Istanbul residents fear homes will collapse",
      "text": "The crack in Mesut Muttaliboglu's bedroom wall is so wide, he can fit a car key into it. He turns it sideways, and with a flick of his wrist, a large chunk of plaster flies off the wall and crashes to the ground. It's why he and his family are moving out of the flat they've lived in for the last 15 years. The whole building has been condemned after failing an earthquake safety test. There's a very high chance that a tremor would bring this whole block crashing to the ground. Here in Istanbul, fear is growing. The two powerful earthquakes in Turkey's south that claimed almost 50,000 lives have brought a new urgency to its biggest city. Home to 15 million people, it sits on the North Anatolian fault line, and experts predict it's due its own major earthquake before 2030. Around 70% of the city's buildings were built before rule changes that enforced stricter construction standards in 1999, and so are considered potentially unsafe. Just three months ago, a study said a quake here could kill up to 90,000 people. Now, the race is on to get the city ready. Mesut knows all too well the devastation a quake can cause. He's just returned from the epicentre in the southern city of Kahramanmaras, where he lost relatives. As we talked in his now-empty flat, he described the moment he found out. \"It happened at 04:17, a relative called and we all woke up screaming.\" Mesut's face crumples into tears and he turns away to compose himself. \"It's a horrible situation. We couldn't get [to Kahramanmaras] for three days because of snow, and when we reached the rubble it was so hard. I can't describe it. I hope God doesn't make anyone else experience this.\" When Mesut returned to Istanbul, the authorities had shut off power and water to his flat. \"I asked for them back again just so we could move. They gave me two more days.\" \"The municipality had sent us written warning about it, but the situation wasn't resolved due to rejections from the neighbours. We knew that our utilities were going to be shut off, and we were ready to leave here, but then the quake happened and it all became a shambles.\" Since the earthquakes in the south, there've been more than 100,000 new applications to the Istanbul municipality for building safety checks. The waiting list for one shot up to three months, then four, and it keeps rising. Tenants as well as landlords can now apply, but some still don't because of the financial implications. The compensation to help those who need to move out of condemned buildings is low. There are no official numbers showing how many fail the test. The city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has promised more training for rescue teams, and preparation of temporary shelters that could house up to 4.5 million people in the aftermath of a quake. But many fear it still isn't enough. A walk down an average Istanbul street tells you why. Many of the buildings have particular design features that can make them collapse if they're put under pressure during a quake. Dr Kurtulus Atasever, a structural and earthquake engineer, met me to point some of them out. We stood on an empty patch of ground, strewn with rocks, that used to be the foundations of a building. When a magnitude 5.8 quake hit Istanbul in 2019, it was so badly damaged it had to be knocked down. Up and down the street, its neighbours have many of the same flaws. Good quality concrete is vital, he tells me. And the architecture is crucial. \"We have some overhangs here. In this type of building we have some weak or soft storeys. There are short columns too, they are actually all typical building problems.\" In very simple terms, each of them weakens a building at ground level, meaning it struggles to hold up the floors above if there's an earthquake. An overhang makes the rest of the building wider than the footprint. Soft storeys are where the ground floor is taller than the floors above it. Short columns don't have enough length compared to their diameter. They can be done safely, Dr Atasever points out, but only if proper thought and planning has gone into the design. In old buildings especially, that's rare. We're standing in the shadow of Yasemin Suleymanoglu's house, and I ask if she's concerned about the apartment block it's in. She holds her daughter's hand and looks up at the face of the building. \"I don't feel safe here,\" she says. \"Our building shook a lot during the 2019 earthquake, and the columns of the one across the street cracked. I've been feeling restless since that sound, and with this latest quake we are really scared. We're losing our sleep because it may hit us any time. And I think we're at risk because our building is old.\" The next step is the development of a 50km (31-mile) long fibre-optic based early warning system. But for a city so huge, it's hard to know where people would go to seek shelter, even if they had notice that a quake was coming. As pictures of the devastation in the south continue to fill Turkish TV screens, these concerns are now front-of-mind for a huge slice of Istanbul's population. And just two months away from important presidential and parliamentary elections, that really matters. Overnight, the earthquake and its aftermath have joined Turkey's economic crisis as a key issue for voters. Many aren't happy with the government's handling of either. The aftershocks here aren't just physical, they're political too.",

      "title": "Mexico kidnapping: A twisted moral code explains cartel's apology",
      "text": "Four Americans were kidnapped by a drug cartel, and two of them were murdered, when they visited the town of Matamoros, Mexico. So why would the cartel apologise for the incident and hand over its own gunmen to the police? A letter left with the cartel gunmen, who had been trussed up and left on the roadside, accused them of acting \"under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\" as well as supposedly breaking cartel rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\". It was signed by the \"Scorpions Group\", a splinter faction of the powerful Gulf Cartel. The letter points to the strange, misplaced sense of civic duty which many Mexican cartels claim to possess. Despite the widespread fear they sow through extortion, murder and kidnapping, groups like the Gulf Cartel and their rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel, profess a twisted code of ethics under which they believe they are looking out for the most vulnerable in Mexican society. That warped understanding of compassion and altruism does not extend to undocumented migrants, who are routinely kidnapped, raped and murdered. Nor are local businesses exempt from paying \"el piso\", an extortion for merely operating on their territory, the tax applied to everyone from multinational companies to small, family-run convenience stores. Yet, there is a logic to the cartel's code of behaviour, particularly in remote and rural parts of Mexico and poor mountainous communities, where organised crime often fills the role left by the state. One need only look at their response after natural disasters. When hurricanes or earthquakes hit the western state of Guerrero, criminal gangs distributed emergency supplies and bags of food, even stamped with their cartel's distinctive initials. A similar phenomenon was seen during the worst moments of the Covid lockdowns too. The cartels also consider themselves the maintainers of community order, handing out brutal summary justice to child rapists or thieves who operate outside their purview. They are the judge, jury and executioners, often quite literally. In that context, the decision to hand over their own gunmen after the debacle in Matamoros adds up: A mistake happened, an apology was made, and the culprits handed in. Case closed. And even Mexican drug cartels are aware of the power of good PR. That sense of neatly curtailing the chaos while apologising to the city's residents must also be taken with a huge pinch of salt, however. How can one be sure these five men were the perpetrators? Who can be trusted to be telling the truth? The drug cartel? The state Attorney General's office? In waters as murky and muddied as those of Tamaulipas state, the wisest instinct is generally to question anything one is told. Lest we forget, Mexico's former Public Security Secretary, Genaro Garcia Luna, who was once the highest official in law enforcement and the man who led the war against drugs, is currently languishing in a US prison having been found guilty of working alongside the Sinaloa Cartel in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. In the Matamoros case, authorities in Mexico have been highlighting the victims' criminal records in their statements to the media. We were initially told the Americans were in town for health tourism - a cheap Mexican tummy tuck that went about as badly wrong as possible. A day later, as allegations began to swirl, a member of the Mexican government forwarded me a story about the victims' criminal past, specifically that one had a conviction for manufacturing illegal narcotics with an intent to supply. \"Just checking you'd seen this\", went the innocuous comment. Whether that was part of a concerted push in Mexico to victim-blame or because there is hard evidence to suggest the kidnapping was targeted is again hard to know. One thing that the entire mess has reminded me of was one of my own trips to Tamaulipas shortly after arriving in Mexico in 2011. It taught me something critical about the drug war in Mexico which has stayed with me to this day. In a non-descript hotel room, I met the girlfriend of a member of the Zetas, a particularly bloodthirsty cartel which today is largely disbanded. As we filmed her in the shadows, her name changed and her voice disguised, she described what her boyfriend did. Without naming the exact organisation, it was clear he worked in law enforcement yet was also a member of the Zetas. A cop by day, a narco by night. \"What you're telling me\", I asked naively, \"is that the relationship between the cartels and the state is very close?\" \"No\", came her chilling reply, \"I'm saying the cartels are the state.\"",

      "title": "Syria Earthquake: Why did the UN aid take so long to arrive?",
      "text": "The UN's delay in delivering life-saving aid to Syrian victims of last month's devastating earthquake was unnecessary, legal experts have told the BBC. They said the UN did not need to wait for permission to enter from the Syrian government or the Security Council and could have applied a broader interpretation of international law. It took a week before the UN got approval from Syria's president to open extra border crossings to allow access to the opposition-held north-west. The UN itself has said it is crucial to try and rescue quake victims within 72 hours. It disputes the BBC's findings that it could have acted differently. \"What matters in terms of responding to an earthquake is time and the immediacy of the response. And the UN just stood there completely paralysed,\" international human rights lawyer, Sarah Kayyali, told the BBC. More than 4,500 people were killed and more than 8,700 injured in north-west Syria by the earthquake, the UN says. Centred near Gaziantep in Turkey, the 6 February 7.8 magnitude tremor and subsequent earthquakes and aftershocks killed at least 45,968 people in Turkey, according to officials there, and about 6,000 in Syria as a whole. Andrew Gilmour was a senior UN official when the first resolution on delivering aid to rebel-held territories to Syria was negotiated in 2014. \"If the law is saying you can't provide milk powder to a starving baby because it's across an international border, then bugger the law,\" he told the BBC. The BBC has spoken to more than a dozen experts in total, including eminent lawyers, professors, retired judges of the International Court of Justice and former UN legal officials. All said that deaths could have been prevented, if the UN had used a different interpretation of international law to allow it to respond in north-west Syria. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told the BBC that: \"To deliver humanitarian aid across an international border, we need either the consent of the government, or in the case that we have in Syria, a binding Security Council resolution... we can have academic discussions for weeks, months, and years about international law. Our position is that international law has not delayed our work.\" In addition to delivering aid itself, the UN also plays a vital role in co-ordinating international relief efforts offered by other countries after a natural disaster. It arranges search and rescue through United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (Undac). Undac teams can deploy anywhere in the world within 12 to 48 hours of a request, which is what happened in Turkey. But the UN made no formal request for emergency medical teams to enter north-west Syria, and was not able to tell us about any formal request for search and rescue teams to deploy there. International humanitarian specialists working on the response have told the BBC that without that call from the UN there was no clear way for emergency teams to deploy. The UN's Stéphane Dujarric says the lack of emergency teams is down to national government decision-making. \"There are security concerns. There are all sorts of political concerns\" which may have influenced this, he says. Marco Sassoli, special advisor to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, said that the Geneva Conventions - the basis of international humanitarian law - provides a framework for the UN to deliver aid without the need for Syria's permission. \"The Geneva Conventions, to which Syria is a party, has a provision stating that an impartial humanitarian body… may offer its services\" to all sides of a conflict, he told the BBC. Victims of the earthquake have complained about the UN's response. Omar Hajji lost his wife and five children to the disaster. He spoke to the BBC in the days following the quake as he looked for his remaining missing son, 14-year-old Abduhrahman. He was finally reunited with him after three days of searching. \"UN aid wasn't sufficient,\" Omar says, who spent days digging through rubble looking for friends and family with his bare hands. \"The most significant aid we received was from locals… If the UN aid had arrived earlier things would've been very different.\" One week after the quake, Martin Griffiths, the UN's head of emergency relief, visited the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. The UN has \"so far failed the people of north-west Syria\", he wrote on Twitter. \"They rightly feel abandoned. Looking for international help that hasn't arrived.\"",

      "text": "Turkey's often divided opposition parties have come together to choose a single candidate to face President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May's election. Kemal Kilicdaroglu leads the main secular opposition party, the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP). Polls suggest a tight race in a country highly polarised after two decades of Mr Erdogan's authoritarian rule. Economic crisis and errors during last month's earthquake may make him more vulnerable than in previous elections. A huge crowd of supporters cheered Mr Kilicdaroglu, a former civil servant, as he was chosen by a six-party opposition alliance. Known as \"Gandhi Kemal\" or \"Turkey's Gandhi\" for his resemblance to Indian civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi, the quiet-spoken 74 year old offers a radically different vision in both substance and style to the fiery, charismatic Mr Erdogan's. However, some of Mr Kilicdaroglu's allies fear he lacks drawing power. He promised his supporters that he would govern Turkey through consensus and consultation. \"Our table is the table of peace,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. \"Our only goal is to take the country to days of prosperity, peace and joy.\" He also said he would return the country to a parliamentary system - Mr Erdogan oversaw a transition to a presidential system in 2018, gaining sweeping powers. The CHP was created by modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and is the country's oldest political party, though it has been out of power centrally since the 1990s. However, Mr Kilicdaroglu has broadened its appeal by embracing minority groups and has formed alliances with right-wing parties. He has also shown himself willing to challenge Mr Erdogan, a leader who has become increasingly intolerant of criticism. In February's earthquake, in which more than 45,000 people were killed in south-eastern Turkey, Mr Kilicdaroglu led attacks on the government, which he said had allowed corruption and poor building standards.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Survivors living in fear on streets",
      "text": "Songul Yucesoy carefully washes her dishes, soaping the plates and cutlery before rinsing off the bubbles and laying them out to dry. An unremarkable scene, except she's outdoors, sitting in the shadow of her ruined house. It tilts at an alarming angle, the window frames are hanging out and there's a large chunk of the rusty iron roof now resting in the garden. A month after the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, those who survived face an uncertain future. One of their most serious problems is finding somewhere safe to live. At least 1.5 million people are now homeless, and it's unclear how long it will take to find them proper shelter. The Turkish disaster agency Afad, meanwhile, says almost two million people have now left the quake zone. Some are living with friends or loved ones elsewhere in the country. Flights and trains out of the region are free to those who want to leave. But in the town of Samandag, near the Mediterranean coast, Songul is clear that she and her family aren't going anywhere. \"This is very important for us. Whatever happens next - even if the house falls down - we will stay here. This is our home, our nest. Everything we have is here. We are not going to leave.\" Precious pieces of furniture have been carefully pulled from the house and set up outside. On top of a polished wooden side table is a holiday souvenir, a picture made of shells from the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. There's a bowl of fruit, with white mould creeping across a large orange. Things that look normal indoors feel strange and out of place when they're sitting in the street. Right now, the whole family is living in three tents just a few steps away from their damaged home. They sleep and eat there, sharing food cooked on a small camping stove. There's no proper toilet, although they've recovered one from the bathroom and are trying to plumb it in in a makeshift wooden shed. They've even created a small shower area. But it's all very basic, and the lack of space and privacy is obvious. These tents are cramped and overcrowded. It's been an agonising month for Songul. Seventeen of their relatives were killed in the quake. Her sister Tulay is officially missing. \"We don't know if she is still under the rubble,\" she tells me. \"We don't know whether her body was taken out yet or not. We're waiting. We can't start mourning. We can't even find our lost one.\" Songul's brother-in-law Husemettin and 11-year-old nephew Lozan died when their apartment building in Iskenderun collapsed around them as they slept. We visited what was left of their home, a sprawling pile of twisted debris. Neighbours told us three blocks of flats had fallen. \"We brought Lozan's body here,\" Songul says quietly. \"We took him from the morgue and buried him close to us in Samandag. Husemettin was buried in the cemetery of the anonymous, we found his name there.\" A picture of the family smiles out of Tulay's still-active Facebook profile, their arms around each other, faces close. Lozan holds a red balloon tightly. The homelessness crisis created by the quake is so acute because of the real shortage of safe spaces that are left standing. More than 160,000 buildings collapsed or were badly damaged. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates at least 1.5 million people are still inside the quake zone, but with nowhere to live. It's hard to know the real figure, and it could be far higher. Study cabins are arriving, but too slowly. Tents have appeared everywhere, from sprawling new encampments to individual ones dotted amidst the rubble. There still aren't enough. News that the Turkish Red Crescent had sold some of its stock of taxpayer-funded tents to a charity group - albeit at cost price - led to frustration and anger. In some cities, people are still living inside public buildings. In Adana, I met families sleeping on blankets and mattresses spread across a volleyball court. In the port city of Iskenderun they have made their home on two trains parked at the railway station. Seats have become beds, luggage racks are filled with personal possessions and the staff there try hard to keep things clean and tidy. Tears fill the eyes of one young girl as she hugs a pillow instead of a teddy bear. This isn't home. Songul's children are struggling, too. Toys and games are stuck inside dangerous houses, and there's no school. \"They're bored, there's nothing to keep them busy. They just sit around. They play with their phones, then go to bed early once they run out of charge.\" When night falls, things are even harder. There's no electricity in Samandag now. Songul has draped colourful solar lights across their white tent, just above the bold UNHCR logo. Homeless in their own country, they're not refugees, but they've still lost everything. \"I put the lamps here to be seen,\" Songul explains. \"We're scared when it gets dark. Having no power is a big problem. The fear is too big, and all night long we feel the aftershocks, so it's hard to sleep.\" Starting to cry, she wipes away the tears with her hand. \"We are free people, we are used to freedom, independence, everyone living in their own houses,\" adds her husband, Savas. \"But now we are three families, eating in one tent, living and sitting in one single tent.\" \"This is all new to us, we don't know what the future holds. And there's always the fear. Our houses have collapsed, what will happen next? We just don't know.\"",

      "title": "Sonic boom heard as RAF jets escort aircraft to Stansted Airport",
      "text": "RAF jets scrambled to escort an aircraft which lost communications caused a sonic boom, police have said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Typhoon jets from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire were authorised to fly supersonic to assist a civilian plane. Essex Police said the aircraft - flying from Iceland to Kenya - was diverted to Stansted Airport, landing at 12.50 GMT. It comes after people heard a \"loud bang\" in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. Two people - a pilot and co-pilot - were on board, Essex Police said. The force said officers carried out enquiries and were satisfied there was a loss of contact due to \"equipment malfunction and nothing of any concern\". The plane and those on board have now been released to continue their journey. A sonic boom is caused when planes fly faster than the speed of sound. Lee Shellard, from Syston, Leicester, said he was watching TV when he heard the bang. \"It shook ornaments and bits around the house,\" he told the BBC. \"But it wasn't like an earthquake, more like a big lorry had gone past. So we nipped outside to see what had happened and other people were looking out of their windows as well \"That's when I went back and checked the CCTV footage.\" Departures from Gatwick airport were reportedly suspended for 15 minutes earlier. BBC journalist Phil Mercer tweeted he had been sitting on a plane at the airport after passengers were told \"all airspace over London is closed as an aircraft has stopped communicating with air traffic control\". BBC East Midlands reporter Will Jefford in Daventry, said he thought his boiler had exploded. \"The whole house shook and we jumped out of the sofa to check if everything was okay,\" he said. \"You could feel the noise through the floorboards. It almost hit you in the chest - I managed to drop half my cup of tea. \"We initially thought the boiler had blown up, but I could hear a jet overhead so realised it was probably a sonic boom.\" A sonic boom is caused when planes fly faster than the speed of sound, which at ground level is around 761mph. When travelling at this speed, also known as Mach 1, the aircraft displaces the air and creates pressure waves that become compressed and are then released in a shock wave. As long as the aircraft is flying at Mach 1 it will generate continuous sound waves, known as a boom carpet and an aircraft flying at 20,000 feet would create a sonic boom cone 20 miles wide. Louise Gourlay in Bicester, Oxfordshire, said her military training kicked in and hit the floor when she heard the bang. \"I'm ex-military, so I immediately 'jumped on my belt buckle' that's a move where I jumped straight down stomach to the floor,\" she said. \"I didn't know if it was an explosion or something, the house shook violently.\" Anne Marie Oostveen near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, told the BBC her \"whole house shook\". \"I was watching TV with my cat Jones and I heard a loud boom sound. \"There is some building work going on nearby so at first I just thought there was a skip being delivered to the yard next door. \"But the videos online make it sound like an explosion, to me it sounded like a low boom. \"My cat just looked up and then went back to sleep.\" Rebecca Cockroft added: \"Going to assume I didn't imagine the sonic boom over #Northampton a few moments ago judging by the car alarms going off and birds scattering?\" A spokesman for Leicestershire Police, said: \"We have received numerous calls in relation to a large explosion sound heard from various parts of the city and county. \"We like to reassure you that there is no concern however thank you for your immediate response to us.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

      "text": "At least 32 people have died and dozens more injured after two trains collided in northern Greece, emergency services say. A train said to be carrying around 350 passengers hit a freight train travelling in the opposite direction near the city of Larissa late on Tuesday night. Rescuers have been working through the night to find survivors, the fire service said. The cause of the crash is not known. The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other train, leading to a fire in at least one of the carriages. One survivor described how the carriage he was in was engulfed in flames as it rolled over following the crash. \"We heard a big bang,\" passenger Stergios Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. \"It was a nightmarish 10 seconds. We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis said. \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\" Another passenger named Angelos Tsiamouras told local media the crash had felt like an earthquake. \"It was a very powerful collision,\" the regional governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, told state-run television. \"This is a terrible night... It's hard to describe the scene.\" Footage of the collision's aftermath showed thick plumes of smoke rising from derailed carriages. At least one of them was completely crushed. Around 150 firefighters and 40 ambulances were at the scene, the fire service said. Conditions for rescue workers were \"very difficult\" because of \"the severity of the collision\", fire service spokesman Vassilis Varthakoyiannis told reporters. \"I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It's tragic. Five hours later, we are finding bodies,\" an exhausted rescuer emerging from the wreckage told AFP news agency. \"We are living through a tragedy. We are pulling out people alive, injured... there are dead. We are going to be here all night, until we finish, until we find the last person,\" another volunteer rescue worker told ERT state broadcaster in comments cited by Reuters.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Erdogan seeks forgiveness over quake rescue delays",
      "text": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has asked people in a heavily quake-hit area of Turkey for understanding over rescue delays, amid mounting anger at the government's response. On a visit to Adiyaman, Mr Erdogan said the tremors and bad weather meant \"we could not work as we would have liked\". \"For this, I ask forgiveness,\" he said. More than 50,000 people are known to have been killed in Turkey and Syria after huge earthquakes on 6 February. A new, smaller quake has hit Turkey. It killed at least one person and injured more than 100 people in Malatya province, north of Adiyaman. Search and rescue teams were trying to find several people believed to be trapped under collapsed buildings. There have been four new earthquakes and 45 aftershocks of magnitudes 5-6 since the two massive quakes on 6 February, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). AFAD chief Orhan Tatar described it as \"very extraordinary activity\". The World Bank says the 6 February quakes caused about $34bn (£28bn) of direct damage in Turkey, but the cost of reconstruction could be about twice that figure. Meanwhile World Bank official Anna Bjerde said the situation in Syria was \"really catastrophic\". Mr Erdogan - who is seeking re-election as president in polls to be held by June - has been touring some of the worst-hit areas. His visit to Adiyaman came after strong criticism of the emergency response there from local people. \"I did not see anyone until 2:00 pm on the second day of the earthquake,\" Adiyaman resident Mehmet Yildirim told AFP earlier this month. \"No government, no state, no police, no soldiers. Shame on you! You left us on our own.\" The disaster left 1.5 million people homeless and many thousands of people remain without shelter or sanitation. There are shortages of tents for survivors. Discontent has spread around the country, with football fans singing \"government resign\" at matches this weekend. Fans of Besiktas in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul threw thousands of soft toys onto the pitch, to be distributed to children affected by the earthquake. Meanwhile riot police detained protesters at a demonstration in Istanbul. More than 160,000 buildings containing 520,000 apartments collapsed or were badly damaged on 6 February. The government says hundreds of people are under investigation and nearly 200 people - including construction contractors and property owners - have already been arrested. Experts had warned for years that endemic corruption and government policies meant many new buildings were unsafe. In Adiyaman, Mr Erdogan vowed to build more than 500,000 new homes along with infrastructure, medical centres and parks. Turkey is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections by June. Mr Erdogan is seeking another term as president after 20 years in power.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquakes: Collapsed buildings investigation widens",
      "text": "More than 600 people are now being investigated in Turkey over buildings that collapsed in the deadly earthquake on 6 February, the government has said. On Saturday, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said 184 suspects - including construction contractors and property owners - had already been arrested. For years, experts warned that endemic corruption and government policies meant many new buildings were unsafe. The confirmed death toll in Turkey and Syria has now exceeded 50,000. Mr Bozdağ made the televised remarks from south-eastern Turkey, where the 7.8 magnitude quake struck and was followed by another powerful tremor just hours later. His comments showed how the investigation had widened - two weeks ago, the authorities said that 113 arrest warrants had been issued. Among those that have been arrested is a mayor of one of the towns close to where the tremors hit, Turkish media reported. More than 160,00 buildings collapsed or were severely damaged in Turkey after the quakes, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings. Opposition parties and some construction experts accuse President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's administration of failing to enforce building regulations and trying to divert overall blame for the disaster. They say that government policies have allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom, including in earthquake-prone regions. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings, but has appeared to blame fate for the scale of the disaster. \"Such things have always happened. It's part of destiny's plan,\" he said during a recent visit to the region. With elections on the horizon, Mr Erdogan's future is on the line after 20 years in power - and his pleas for national unity have gone unheeded.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: How survivors cope with trauma",
      "text": "The death toll from the devastating earthquakes that recently struck Turkey and Syria has climbed beyond 50,000 - and left many more people homeless. It has taken a terrible toll on mental health for those caught up in the tragedy, both directly and indirectly. The BBC has spoken with survivors, search and rescue teams, and experts. It was past midnight when we arrived in Antakya, walking through darkness in a city left completely in ruins. Our car had broken down and the replacement driver refused to take us to the city centre. It was the third day after the earthquakes hit south-east Turkey. Our team had come from Maras, the epicentre of the quakes. Already thousands of people were confirmed dead and that number has continued to rise ever since. As we advanced down the main road into Antakya, the constant siren of ambulances echoed through the rubble. Aid trucks, bulldozers and volunteers were all stuck in queues of traffic that stretched for miles. It was a state of utter chaos in the freezing cold. Burak Galip Akkurt and his team from Turkey's voluntary rescue association, Akut, were working on a four-storey building. They suspected there were 10 people alive under the rubble, five of them children. Their torches pierced the darkness of the wreckage as they shouted the question that has become so familiar it cuts through Turkey like a knife: \"Can anyone hear me?\" They waited in complete silence, hoping for the faintest voice to call back or even to hear the sound of a simple movement, a tap of a finger, a click. \"When you hear a voice coming from under the rubble, how does that make you feel?\" I asked Burak in a quiet moment. He needed to be detached from his feelings in order to carry on with the rescuing effort, he explained, but it would hit him once the mission was over and he would seek psychological help to cope with everything he had witnessed. \"It is not very easy to recover from the things you have seen. It is traumatic, and very dramatic as well.\" No-one survived from under the rubble of the apartment block they were working on that night. The next day I met Dilek Eger. She was rescued from a building in the neighbouring town of Iskenderun, after being trapped for eight hours. \"The tremor was incredibly strong. I immediately got up from bed and ran to my parents' room. I was screaming my lungs out. But my mother, father, brother, they were all silent. I thought I was going to lose my mind,\" she told me. Dilek's parents and brother lost their lives under the rubble. She was stuck, surrounded by broken glass, with only the top of her head showing. A family friend was able to recognise and rescue her with his bare hands and a knife. She couldn't cry at all for the first two days, but as she lay on the sofa in her grandmother's living room, talking me softly through her ordeal, she visibly started to go through all the emotions. As she kissed and caressed a photograph of her mother and herself hugging, she began sobbing. \"My mother gave her last breath in my arms,\" she said. \"Even when dying, she saved me, as she was on top of me. I couldn't do anything for her. \"My brother was stuck in the other room, and my dad was suffering in pain. This is when the whole world collapses. You are witnessing the death of everyone you love. I don't feel anger or revenge. I just feel so empty.\" Dilek is one of tens of thousands of people to have survived the earthquake, but she now faces a life that may be scarred forever. This week I received a text message from another survivor. He wrote: \"Those of us who are now alive will stay under the rubble until the day we die.\" Psychologists say the survivors of such a traumatic event will be going through phases: the initial shock, anxiety and fear will soon be replaced by a state of denial. Cagay Duru from the Turkish Psychologists Association said it was not easy to cope with a trauma on this scale, but talking about it, expressing feelings and thoughts about what has been experienced should be the first step towards healing. He warned that if psycho-social support was not in place for those in need during this grief process, then many people could end up with serious disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression or substance abuse. \"We all have to ask each other: How are you? Is there anything I can do for you? \"We have to say: I am here for you. We must give the message that we are in solidarity with those in need and we are trying to understand their experience, we are there to listen to them, help them and share all these emotions.\" Normality would not mean returning to how life was before the earthquake, it would be a new normal, he warned. That new normal would need to be built up and it would take time. But the difficulty of that task was underlined when a new set of earthquakes hit the already devastated town of Hatay. These were not as strong as the initial two, but still panic-stricken people were on the streets, crying in despair, wondering whether they were facing a nightmare without end. Some were furious, asking what more could have been done to save lives. Now in Istanbul, I have left the disaster zone, but I am still surrounded by trauma; glued to my TV screen and mobile phone like millions of others. As Turkey's biggest city lies on a major fault line, people here cannot help but ask: Will they be going through the same tragedy in the future? What can they do to prevent it? As grief sets in, mass trauma and how to respond to it has become another of Turkey's big challenges.",

      "title": "Earthquake: Brynmawr, Cardiff and valleys feel tremors",
      "text": "An earthquake has shaken parts of Wales overnight. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said the 3.7 magnitude quake happened at 23:59 GMT on Friday. The epicentre was just north of Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, and west of Crickhowell, Powys. BBC journalist Alex Humphreys said she felt the \"mini earthquake\" in Cardiff, 30 miles (50km) away. Gwent Police said it had received \"multiple calls\" overnight but it was \"business as usual\" for the force. The BGS said the earthquake was 1.8 miles (3km) under the Earth's surface. \"My whole bed shook,\" Ms Humphreys tweeted. Others described it as a \"scary\" experience. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the UK was in the North Sea on 7 June 1931, with a magnitude of 6.1. The epicentre was in the Dogger Bank area, 75 miles (120km) north-east of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Wales' most powerful quake was on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, in 1984 - measuring 5.4, it began at a depth of more than 12 miles (20km). The BGS said smaller quakes were not unusual in Wales, with 70 measuring more than 3.5 between 1727 and 1984. Listeners told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that they felt the \"earth shake\" in Ebbw Vale, which brought people out of their homes and into the streets. Robert Griffiths, from Rhiwbina, Cardiff, said he had just sat down to watch TV after a night out when \"all of a sudden the whole house shook\". \"The ceiling creaked, we immediately turned the television off and thought 'what on Earth was that?' \"It was kind of like 20 trucks had driven in front of the house so it was most unusual and quite strange.\" Elsewhere, Cat said she \"thought we were going mad\" in Blaenavon, Torfaen, as her \"bed and house shook side to side\". \"My husband ran downstairs to see what was going on,\" she said. Dr Ian Stimpson, a senior geologist at Keele University, in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, said such events \"happen relatively infrequently\" in the UK. \"They are a big shock. An earthquake of this size, probably the UK has about three of them a year on average,\" he said. \"These earthquakes are way smaller than the Turkish earthquake for example - that was a million times more powerful than the earthquake last night.\" Other recent earthquakes in Wales were much smaller than Friday's - the BGS reported a tremor with a magnitude of 0.9 in Llwynmawr, near Chirk, Wrexham, on 4 February, one of 1.1 at Llandybie, Carmarthenshire, on 20 January and one with a magnitude of 2 at Llanbedr, Powys, on 27 December.",

      "title": "Turkish journalists detained over earthquake reports",
      "text": "Freelance journalist Mir Ali Koçer was 200 miles from the epicentre when Turkey was struck by a deadly earthquake on 6 February. Grabbing his camera and microphone, he drove down to the affected region to interview survivors. He shared stories of survivors and rescuers on Twitter and is now under investigation on suspicion of spreading \"fake news\" and could face up to three years in jail. He is one of at least four journalists being investigated for reporting or commenting on the earthquake. Press freedom groups say dozens more have been detained, harassed or prevented from reporting. At least 50,000 people were killed when earthquakes hit both Turkey and Syria. Turkey's authorities have not commented on the detentions. On the night of the earthquake, Mr Koçer - who is Kurdish and contributes to pro-opposition news sites such as Bianet and Duvar - was smoking on his balcony in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, when his two dogs suddenly started barking. He later remembered how they had barked just like that in 2020, seconds before a smaller earthquake hit eastern Turkey. \"I felt I was shaking. I felt the house shaking, I felt the TV shaking,\" says Mr Koçer. He hid under a dinner table with the dogs and then rushed outside. Mr Koçer left Diyarbakir and drove to the city of Gaziantep. He was shocked by scenes of destruction and victims enduing freezing temperatures in towns near the very epicentre of the quake. At least 3,000 of the earthquake's victims died in Gaziantep. \"When holding the microphone, behind the camera or in front of the camera, I could not hold back my tears,\" Mr Koçer recalls. Mr Koçer was touched by the influx of volunteers and rescue teams coming from Western Turkey, and he shared their stories on Twitter. Some of the survivors told him they received no aid for days. Similar complaints were cited across pro-opposition media outlets. Visiting the earthquake-affected areas, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the people he would rebuild their cities. But he also warned that those spreading \"fake news\" and \"causing social chaos\" would be prosecuted, calling them \"provocateurs\". Mr Koçer says that while he was reporting from the region hit by the earthquake, Diyarbakir police left a note at his apartment, instructing him to visit the police station and give a statement. At the station, he was told that he was being investigated under a recently introduced disinformation law. He said the police questioned him about his reporting from the earthquake epicentre and accused him of spreading false information. Turkey's new law was adopted in October. It criminalised the public spreading of disinformation and gave the state much broader powers to control news sites and social media. The Venice Commission, a legal watchdog of the Council of Europe, said the law would interfere with freedom of expression. Opposition parties call it a \"censorship law\". Mr Koçer insists that he was meticulous in his work and interviewed all sides, from survivors to the police, the gendarmerie and rescue workers. \"I did not share information without thorough research and analysis,\" he says. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called the investigation against Mr Koçer \"absurd\" and urged the authorities to drop it. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an advocacy group, at least three more journalists are facing criminal charges. Merdan Yanardağ and Enver Aysever are prominent Istanbul-based political commentators with large social media followings. Both have criticised the government's rescue efforts. They're both under investigation along with Mehmet Güleş, who, like Mr Koçer, is based in Diyarbakir. He was detained on suspicion of \"inciting hatred\" for interviewing a volunteer critical of the government's rescue effort and later released, according to RSF. The number of other journalists under investigation is unclear. On Tuesday, the police said they detained 134 people over \"provocative posts\" and arrested 25 of them, but their identities have not been disclosed. Some of those detained may well have been spreading falsehoods, including one that Afghan migrants had been scavenging in ruined neighbourhoods. But critics say the clampdown has gone far beyond those spreading harmful disinformation. \"The government is trying to suppress information coming from the quake zone,\" says cyber rights expert Yaman Akdeniz who teaches at the Istanbul Bilgi University. The arrests came after Turkey's presidential communications director warned against \"lethal disinformation\" jeopardising the rescue efforts. The directorate also rolled out a smartphone app called \"Disinformation Reporting Service\" encouraging people to report manipulative posts about the quake. \"Any time [Turkish] officials and the government are being criticised, they don't like it,\" says Arzu Geybulla, a journalist in Istanbul covering digital authoritarianism and censorship. \"But this time they are perhaps more vocal.\" The BBC contacted Turkey's presidential directorate for communications asking about the journalists investigated and the calls by advocacy groups to drop investigations, but has had no response.",

      "title": "Turkey-Syria earthquake: UK aid appeal passes £100m",
      "text": "An aid appeal for earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria has raised more than £100m in just two weeks. The bid for donations was organised by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) - an umbrella group of UK charities. Major earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria on 6 February, killing more than 44,000 people and injuring more than 100,000. Turkey was hit by another quake this week, with a 6.4 magnitude tremor near the southern city of Antakya, which killed at least six people. According to the UN, 1.5 million people in the south of Turkey have been left homeless following the earthquakes. Thousands of buildings, including hospitals and schools, have collapsed in Turkey and Syria. Infrastructure, including roads and energy supplies, has been badly damaged. The DEC campaign was launched on 9 February on television and radio, and so far has raised £101.5m. It has been supported by celebrities including Daniel Craig, Tamsin Greig, Sir Michael Palin and Reverend Richard Coles. The group said money raised would go towards \"providing emergency shelter, medical care, hot food and food parcels, blankets, bedding and other household items, clean water and safe spaces for children\". Personal donations have been made to the appeal by King Charles, the Queen Consort and the Prince and Princess of Wales. The UK government has also contributed £5m to the fund, through the UK Aid Match scheme where it matches donations on charity appeals. Saleh Saeed, chief executive of the DEC, said the public had \"once again excelled and supported people when they need it most\". \"With a third earthquake, people are terrified all over again. They are scared of being in their own homes if they remain standing, and are worried about being unable to provide for their families with no job to go to,\" he said. Actor Daniel Craig said the response from the public had been \"incredibly moving to see\", while Sir Michael Palin said the crisis is \"deepening\" for many people in Turkey and Syria. \"It is bitterly cold in Turkey and northwest Syria and it's hard to grasp how families are coping,\" he said.",

      "text": "A baby born under the rubble of a collapsed building in Syria, and the only member of her immediate family to survive a massive earthquake, has been adopted by her aunt and uncle. Thousands of people had offered to adopt the newborn, who was still connected to her mother by her umbilical cord when she was rescued. She was discharged from hospital after a DNA test confirmed her aunt was a blood relative. Doctors said she was in good health. \"She is one of my children now,\" her uncle by marriage Khalil al-Sawadi told the Associated Press news agency.\" I will not differentiate between her and my children.\" The baby has now been named after her late mother Afraa. Shortly after she was rescued, officials had named her Aya, which means miracle in Arabic. A video of her rescue shortly after the tremor went viral on social media. Dramatic footage showed a man sprinting away from the debris as he carried her covered in dust in his arms. She had reportedly been under the collapsed building for more than 10 hours and doctors said she had arrived to hospital in a bad condition, with bruises and cuts all over her body. The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border. Her mother went into labour soon after the disaster and gave birth before she died, a relative said. Her father, four siblings and an aunt were also killed. \"This girl means so much to us because there's no-one left of her family besides this baby,\" Mr Sawadi told Reuters news agency. \"She'll be a memory for me, for her aunt and for all of our relatives in the village of her mother and father.\" Mr Sawadi, who was present when she was rescued, told the Associated Press he had been worried someone might kidnap Afraa during her two weeks in hospital as offers to adopt her flooded in. Her family who took her in said that the best place for Afraa was with family, however difficult their situation. Mr Sawadi and his wife Hala's home was also destroyed in the earthquake and they are staying with cousins. They both welcomed a baby girl born to Hala three days after the earthquake.",

      "title": "6.4 magnitude earthquake hits southern Turkey",
      "text": "A 6.4 magnitude earthquake has struck southern Turkey, weeks after a deadly quake devastated the region. Turkey's disaster and emergency agency Afad said the tremor occurred at 20.04 local time (17.04 GMT). Witnesses told the Reuters news agency there had been further damage to buildings in Antakya. A 7.8-magnitude struck the region on 6 February, killing more than 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The mayor of Hatay, in southern Turkey, has said people are trapped under the rubble. The Turkish vice president said at least eight people were injured in the earthquake. Turkish authorities have recorded more than 6,000 aftershocks since that earthquake hit, but the BBC team in the region said today's tremor felt much stronger than previous ones. Witnesses said it was also felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. It is currently unclear how much damage it has caused or if there are any casualties. Muna Al Omar, a local resident, told Reuters she was in a tent in a park in central Antakya when the earthquake hit. \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" she said, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. \"Is there going to be another aftershock?\" she asked. An AFP journalist reported on scenes of panic in Antakya - which was already devastated by the previous earthquake - with the latest tremors raising clouds of dust in the city. The walls of badly damaged buildings also crumbled, AFP reports, with several apparently injured people calling for help. Ali Mazlum said he was looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquake when the latest one hit. \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall. It felt like the earth was opening up to swallow us up,\" he said. Antakya, the capital of Turkey's Hatay Province, was one of the places hit most severely by the earthquake on 6 February. In a tweet, Afad urged people to stay away from coastlines as a precaution against the risk of rising sea levels, although the warning was later removed. In Syria, the civil defence group White Helmets said several people were injured by falling buildings.",

      "title": "Cyclone Gabrielle: Rebuilding cost on par with Christchurch quake - NZ",
      "text": "New Zealand has said rebuilding after Cyclone Gabrielle will cost billions of dollars, on par with the Christchurch earthquake from 12 years ago. Gabrielle brought widespread flooding to the North Island in mid-February, damaging roads and bridges. At least 11 people have died and thousands remain missing. \"It's going to be the biggest weather event this century, with a billion dollar price tag,\" Finance Minister Grant Robertson said. Mr Robertson told TVNZ over the weekend that the government would first attend to survivors' most urgent needs - food, shelter, electricity and communications. \"We have a long journey ahead of us to rebuild after this disaster, but we have the resources to do it, and we have the will to do it,\" Mr. Robertson said. Farmers lost entire harvests and herds to the floods and authorities are still determining how much of it will be covered by insurance, said the minister, who is in charge of rebuilding efforts. On Monday, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced an additional NZ$250m to fix damaged roads and a NZ$50m-support package to give immediate relief for businesses. New Zealand spent NZ$13bn ($8.1bn; £6.7bn) to rebuild from the powerful earthquake in the South Island in 2011 that levelled much of the Christchurch city centre and left 185 people dead and thousands homeless. Mr Robertson blamed the extent of the damage inflicted by Gabrielle on New Zealand's failure to build infrastructure that's resilient to climate change, adding that the current approach to adapt \"has not been sufficiently robust\". Not even tens of billions of dollars in additional infrastructure spending over the next five years can fill in the gaps, he added. \"The deficit is so large, we will not be able to make up for it in the long term,\" he said. Mr Hipkins also said the state of national emergency due to Gabrielle will be extended for seven days. It applies to Northland, Auckland, Tairāwhiti, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawke's Bay and Tararua. This is only the third time in New Zealand's history that the country has issued a national emergency declaration to speed up rescue and relief efforts - the last time was in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake. Mr Hipkins said more than 6,500 people were uncontactable after the cyclone, but added that authorities knew that about 4,200 of them were alright. Around 15,000 people are still without power in the North Island, the PM said. About 70% of those are in Napier and surrounding areas. Gabrielle struck a few weeks after heavy rains flooded the capital Auckland, also on the North Island. That deluge paralysed the city's airport, photos of which went viral on social media. Many of the roads damaged by Gabrielle are still closed. Tanker trucks cannot collect milk, some logging is suspended and meat processing is scaled down, Reuters reported. The cyclone also disrupted picking in apple and pear farms, where annual production is valued at NZ$1 billion. Many of these areas are still inaccessible. Farm damage could push food prices higher, adding pressure to inflation that's already running at a near three-decade high of 7.2%.",

      "text": "The body of footballer Christian Atsu, who died when an earthquake hit Turkey two weeks ago, has been returned to his native Ghana. The flight landed in Accra late on Sunday, and his coffin was carried away by members of Ghana's armed forces. Atsu was found dead on Saturday under his home in southern Turkey. He had been playing for the Hatayspor club. The winger played 65 times for Ghana's national team and helped his side reach the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final. The 31-year-old also played for Premier League sides Everton and Newcastle. Speaking at Kotoka airport in the capital Accra, Ghana's Vice-President Mahamudu Bawmia said: \"We hoped against hope, every day that passed, we prayed and prayed. But alas, when he was found, he was no more.\" Mr Bawmia added the late footballer was much loved and would be sorely missed. \"It is a painful loss, a very painful one.\" He promised Atsu would be given a \"befitting\" burial. Atsu had been missing since the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 6 February caused the collapse of his apartment in Antakya, in hard-hit Hatay province. The Hatayspor club initially reported the player had been rescued with injuries, but this position was later changed - and his agent confirmed the news of his death on Twitter on Saturday. Over 44,000 people are confirmed to have lost their lives across south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria. The footballer's remains were accompanied from Turkey by his family and Ghana's ambassador to Turkey, Francisca Ashietey-Odunton, Ghana's foreign ministry said. The plane landed at 19:25 GMT in Accra where it was met by relatives, government officials and representatives of the Ghana Football Association. The coffin was later due to be transported to a military hospital morgue. Tributes have poured in for the late player. On Saturday, his wife Marie-Claire Rupio and their three children joined fans marking a minute's silence in Newcastle, before the side's Premier League match against Liverpool. Atsu played for Newcastle from 2016 to 2021. Atsu's face was shown on the big screen and away fans chanted \"you'll never walk alone\", before breaking into applause. On Sunday, Ghana captain Mohammed Kudus paid tribute to his former teammate after scoring for Dutch side Ajax, removing his jersey to reveal a white shirt with \"RIP Atsu\" written on it. Meanwhile, the charity Arms Around The Child haled Atsu - who has been an ambassador for the organisation since 2016 - and said he had been the \"main benefactor\" of a school in Ghana that supports abandoned children, orphans, the chronically ill and those rescued from trafficking. Atsu, they said, was \"a young boy from poverty in Ghana who followed his dreams and used his talent and platform to help others\".",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Rescue effort ends in all but two areas",
      "text": "Turkey has ended rescue efforts in all but two provinces, almost two weeks after a massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people, the country's disaster agency said. Searches will continue in Kahramanmaras and Hatay, the agency's chief said. Survivors were still being pulled from the rubble on Friday, but hopes are fading of finding anyone else alive. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey on Sunday. His trip had been planned before the disaster. The epicentre of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on 6 February was in Kahramanmaras. More than 44,000 people are confirmed to have lost their lives in south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria. The death toll is expected to climb, with about 345,000 apartments in Turkey known to have been destroyed and many people still missing. Neither Turkey nor Syria have said how many people are still unaccounted for. \"In many of our provinces, search and rescue efforts have been completed,\" the disaster agency's chief, Yunus Sezer, told reporters in Ankara. He said search and rescue efforts were continuing at around 40 buildings in the two provinces, but he expected this number to fall by Sunday evening. Rescue workers pulled at least three people from the rubble on Friday, more than 11 days after they were trapped when the earthquake hit. Mr Blinken has arrived in Turkey to show support, despite the trip being planned before the quake. It will be his first trip to Turkey since he took office more than two years ago. He will travel to Hatay to see humanitarian efforts before travelling to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday. The pair are expected to discuss issues including Turkey's refusal to ratify Sweden and Finland's Nato membership applications.",

      "title": "Syrian earthquake victims being sent 'home' from Turkey for burial",
      "text": "Aysha Moarri, 45, is sobbing while caressing a white, quilted body bag on the back of a lorry. \"How are you leaving me behind? You were the only reason that I stayed alive... How can I breathe now?\" Her daughter is inside. Next to her are the bodies of five other members of their family. It's another cold bright afternoon at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing between southern Turkey and opposition-held north-western Syria. Syrian refugee families who have lost loved ones in the earthquake that struck southern Turkey last week are gathered there to help repatriate their bodies. Around us the heavy smell of death hangs in the air. Aysha, her husband Nouman, and their four-year-old granddaughter Elma, were the only survivors after the six-story block of flats they were living in collapsed. Aysha and Nouman lost two daughters, one son, and two granddaughters, and were still searching for their son-in-law. The family fled the civil war in Syria eight years ago, hoping for a fresh start, and took refuge in the southern Turkish city of Antakya. The city is now in ruins, with more than half of its buildings damaged. The name of each Syrian victim brought to Bab al-Hawa is written with a blue pen on the body bags, to ensure they can be identified once back home. \"Take good care of each other. Shirin, my dear, take care of your brother and sister and my beloved grandchildren,\" says Aysha as she kisses her daughter's body through the white cloth. Her fingers linger on the lorry as it begins to pull away, clearly not wanting to let go. Her husband breaks into tears at the sight of the truck crossing the border. \"Goodbye my dears... You will all go home... You will be together,\" Nouman says, waving a bandaged hand. That morning, five more lorries arrive at the border carrying the bodies of Syrians recovered from under the rubble. Some are just wrapped in blankets, rather than body bags. Among the wreckage of the the Moarri family's flat back in Antakya, two glass pomegranates sit perfectly intact on a shelf. A painting still hangs above the table. The rest of the room has collapsed. Wearing a high-visibility vest, Ali, who was engaged to Aysha's middle daughter, Viam, carries on searching through the rubble. He shows us where he found Viam's body. They had been in love for four years but it was only a week before the earthquake that he had persuaded her father to accept their engagement. \"That night we were still texting each other on WhatsApp until late. We weren't able to sleep,\" he says. At around 04:00 he received a text message from Viam: \"Are you awake? I had a weird nightmare,\" she wrote. They were in the middle of a video call when the earth started to shake. \"I had just been telling her that she shouldn't think about that bad dream. And then we told each other we loved each other. She was sitting on her bed and laughing quietly,\" Ali recalls, trying hard to not break into tears. \"I saw her trying to run, but her phone was plugged into the wall and it slowed her down. Then the picture froze. The screen went black.\" A fitness trainer who has combat training experience with the armed opposition in Syria, Ali was able to protect himself by crawling under the table in his room. \"When the earthquake finished, I ran out. Our whole neighbourhood was devastated. \"I can't remember how I walked to the street where she [Viam] was living. It took me twice as long as all the roads were blocked.\" When he got to the block of flats, a makeshift rescue operation organised by neighbours was already under way. He called friends to join them. Hours went by and no official aid came. Ali says he and his friends are from areas of Syria that have been frequently bombed by Syrian government forces during the war, so they have had some training and experience in search and rescue already. Syrians have to help Syrians, he adds. Part of the large area of north-western Syria affected by the earthquake is under the control of the Syrian government. Another part - where the Moarri family is from - is held by armed groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. The co-ordination of the rescue and aid operations has therefore been highly complex, involving multiple parties to the conflict, the countries supporting them and international humanitarian organisations. Ali feels resentful towards the international community, saying powerful countries are playing out larger conflicts in Syria and that the Syrian people are suffering as a result. \"All the world came to help Turkey, and thank God that Turkey is a strong country itself. But how about Syria?\" \"I don't want to talk about politics but from a humanitarian point of view, we don't have electricity, or clean water, not even homes.\" He added: \"Our houses have been devastated by the war, and now the earthquake. Of course, we accept what comes from God. But I should tell the world: enough.\" After eight days of searching, Ali found the body of his beloved Viam. She was hugging her brother Mohammed when she died. Now, with a group of 15 fellow Syrians, Ali is working to find other Syrian families. Fine concrete dust covers them. It is everywhere here - making our eyes gritty, and our hair grey. During the first 10 days after the earthquake more than 2,306 bodies were sent over the border into Syria, according to Turkish authorities. Turkish border police tell us that it has been a massive operation for them, and a challenging one to co-ordinate. Sometimes they are ready to send the bodies, but the other side is not ready to receive them. Sometimes, it is the opposite. As we prepare to leave, we see a man cuddling the body of his three-week-old baby wrapped in a small blanket. He is asking for help to take her body back to their home in an opposition-held part of Idlib province. He had dug his daughter out of the rubble, then brought her across the border to Turkey for medical treatment. But she did not survive. The Moarri family finally recovered the last person they were looking for - the body of their son-in-law - 10 days after the earthquake. I ask Ali why the Syrian refugees are sending their family's bodies to Syria. \"It is our home. It is where we still hope and believe that one day we will go back to. We want our loved ones to wait for us there.\"",

      "text": "Syria's military says five people have died after what it alleged were Israeli missiles hit the capital Damascus and surrounding areas on Sunday. Officials said a building was hit in the central Kafr Sousa neighbourhood, killing four civilians and one soldier. The densely populated district is home to a large, heavily guarded security complex. Israel's military declined to comment on the strike when approached by Reuters news agency. Israel frequently attacks targets in Syria linked to Iran and Hezbollah militants but rarely acknowledges its actions. Sunday's attack was the first since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the north-west of the country, as well as parts of neighbouring Turkey, 12 days ago. The Kafr Sousa area is home to senior officials and security agencies, but also civilians living in residential buildings. The strike - which hit at 00:22 local time (21:22 GMT) - caused damage to several homes in Damascus neighbourhoods and other nearby areas, Syrian officials said. The country's defence ministry said the rockets were launched from the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau south-west of Damascus which was annexed by Israel in 1981. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 15 people, including civilians. \"The strike on Sunday is the deadliest Israeli attack in the Syrian capital,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the observatory. It comes over a month after an Israeli strike hit Damascus's international airport, according to the Syrian army, killing four people including two soldiers. Israel has previously acknowledged that it targets the bases of militant groups loyal to Iran. The two countries are arch-foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a \"shadow war\" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Antakya now unrecognisable to tour guide",
      "text": "Weaving around fallen slabs of concrete, we make our way deeper into the heart of Antakya, the capital of Turkey's Hatay Province. The city's roads are filled with diggers and rescue workers in hard hats, Turkish military and police. Our guide, Mehmet Severoğlu, has been a tour guide for 20 years since he retired as an electrical engineer. He has explained the history of Antakya to thousands of tourists, and this is his first time back into the city since the earthquake nearly two weeks ago. \"Antakya is a place where I find my soul,\" he tells us. \"It is a city with so many different ethnicities, different religions and they all live in tolerance here. \"It is multicultural, multilingual - tourists enjoy this area a lot. So did I.\" Antakya, known in Roman and medieval times as Antioch, is an ancient city. Founded in 300 BC, it was a regional capital for the Roman Empire. It was also one of the earliest centres of Christianity and important for both Judaism and Islam. But the city is almost unrecognisable. We park next to the region's government office, where the building's clock has stopped at 04:34, which was the time just a few minutes after the earthquake hit on the morning of 6 February. We walk past a pile of white stones and black steel ornate gates, the city's Protestant Church. Turning left, we pass a hotel, built when Antakya was under French mandate after World War One. Its stonework is smashed, ripped open to the elements. Mehmet stops. \"I cant recognise where I am,\" he says, trying to orientate himself. Almost all his usual points of reference have been destroyed. We try one street, then another, clambering over smashed terracotta roof tiles, splintered wood and bent metal supports. Each time we climb one pile, the next is even higher, until we can't get much further safely. Above us, the contents of homes bulge precariously - beds, chairs, bricks, door frames, bursting through walls and window frames. They're what remain of the lives that were lived here. Mehmet does recognise one spot from his tours, covered in cement dust, its sign hanging. \"This store used to serve hummus for 150 years, the best hummus place in Antakya,\" he says. \"When we brought our groups to this place, they would welcome us with hot plates. Now I don't think it will ever be back.\" I ask him if he knows what happened to the people who ran the shop. \"Two have left [Antakya], but I have no idea about the rest.\" He pauses, his voice starting to choke. \"Very sad.\" We find the remains of the Greek Orthodox Church by spotting its bell, which is now lying on its side at the top of a 3m-high (9ft 8in) pile of bricks. The bell tower it stood in is now dust. Using a drone, we can see the remains of its ornate arches, but the rest of the building is gone. We head to Antakya's synagogue: what would normally be a five-minute walk now requires a 10-minute drive around the few roads that have been cleared. The doors are locked, but Mehmet tells us the small community were able to rescue their holy books and flee. He makes a phone call to one of his friends whose restaurant looks to be still standing. When his friend picks up, Mehmet is visibly relieved. \"I am glad to hear your voice,\" he says. \"I am afraid to call people because I don't know whether they are dead or alive.\" His friend tells him that his family has survived, but that his business partner and their entire family were killed. Antakya's market is empty, except for a few shop owners trying to clear their stores. We see one man weeping outside a butcher's shop where his nephew worked. \"Our dear one has gone,\" he says. \"The world has ended for me.\" We leave him quietly praying. Our final visit is to Habibi Neccar, one of the first mosques in the region of Hatay. \"This mosque's story is the same as Hatay's history,\" says Mehmet. \"So many civilisations have been and gone here. \"It is known that seven big earthquakes have been recorded through history here. It is not the first time that Hatay has been destroyed, but each time we have rebuilt. We will be reborn again.\"",

      "title": "Christian Atsu found dead after Turkey earthquake - BBC Sport",
      "text": "Footballer Christian Atsu has been found dead under the rubble of his home almost two weeks after the Turkey earthquake, his agent has confirmed. Atsu had been missing since the 6 February quake that caused the collapse of his apartment in Antakya, Hatay. \"There are no words to describe our sadness,\" tweeted his Turkish top-flight club Hatayspor. \"We will not forget you, Atsu. Peace be upon you, beautiful person.\" In the aftermath of the quake, Hatayspor initially reported Atsu had been rescued \"with injuries\", but a day later that position changed. His agent Nana Sechere, who has been in Hatay, confirmed the news on Saturday on Twitter, writing: \"It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to announce to all well wishers that sadly Christian Atsu's body was recovered this morning. \"My deepest condolences go to his family and loved ones. I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their prayers and support.\" Atsu joined Hatayspor in September 2022 after a season with Saudi Arabian team Al-Raed and scored the winning goal in a Super Lig match on 5 February. He won 65 caps for Ghana and helped his country reach the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final where they lost to Ivory Coast on penalties. Atsu was later named player of the tournament. He joined Chelsea from Porto in 2013 and had several loan spells at clubs including Everton and Bournemouth. An initial loan spell at Newcastle in 2016, in which he helped the team win promotion from the Championship to the Premier League, was made permanent in 2017. \"We are profoundly saddened to learn that Christian Atsu has tragically lost his life in Turkey's devastating earthquakes,\" Newcastle said in a tweet. \"A talented player and a special person, he will always be fondly remembered by our players, staff and supporters.\" Everton said they were \"deeply saddened\" by the news, while Chelsea said they were \"devastated\". The earthquake and aftershocks in southern Turkey and northern Syria are known to have killed more than 40,000 people.",

      "title": "Turkey-Syria earthquake: Survivor rescued after 278 hours under flattened building",
      "text": "Rescue workers in Turkey have pulled at least three people from the rubble, over 11 days after they were trapped when an earthquake hit the country. Hakan Yasinoglu had been stuck under a flattened building in the hard-hit Hatay province for 278 hours when workers reached him on Friday. Teenager Osman Halebiye and Mustafa Avci, 34, were also saved in Antakya. \"I had completely lost all hope. This is a true miracle,\" Mr Avci's father told Reuters news agency. \"I thought nobody could be saved alive from there,\" he added. Mr Avci's daughter was just a few hours old when the quake struck, and as he was loaded onto a stretcher by paramedics he was connected with his child via video call. His wife, Bilge Avci, managed to avoid the earthquake's devastation and escaped with their child - but Mr Avci got trapped under the rubble, according to local media. Mr and Mrs Avci - and baby Almile - were reunited late on Friday at a hospital in the southern city of Mersin. The latest rescues come as the death toll caused by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey and Syria passed 41,000 - a figure which is expected to rise dramatically. As time passes, officials are less optimistic that they can continue to rescue people trapped beneath the rubble. This is partly due to limits on how long the human body can survive without water, and experts say most rescues occur within the first 24 hours of a disaster. The reality was reflected as Mr Yasinoglu, in his 40s, was taken from the ruins of a building to a waiting ambulance. Unlike previous rescues which saw search teams celebrating, the mood on the ground was subdued and sombre, AFP news agency reported. Meanwhile, around the world, Muslims have performed absentee funeral prayers for the many who were unable to receive full burial rites. The UN has launched an appeal for over $1bn (£830m) to fund the Turkish relief operation, and another $400m (£332m) for Syrians. Aid groups say survivors will need months of help to rebuild their lives. The Turkish government has also faced criticism over its handling of the disaster, and some have questioned the state's preparation for such a tragedy. But while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has conceded that the emergency response to the disaster was slow in places, he has urged Turks not to listen to those whom he accuses of politicising a tragedy. Neighbouring Syria's death toll has not changed for several days. Most of the casualties have been reported in the opposition-held north-west, where aid has been slow to arrive. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Friday that President Bashar al-Assad's forces had shelled the western town of Atareb and other quake-ravaged areas held by rebels, in the first fighting since the earthquake struck. The BBC has not verified these reports.",

      "text": "A woman said she \"cried for a long time\" when she was reunited with her parents after their house collapsed in the earthquake that hit Turkey. Seyma Yapar's parents managed to escape as the walls of their home fell in during the disaster on 6 February. Ms Yapar, from Sale, Greater Manchester, managed to fly out and surprise them on Friday. \"I felt so relieved to see them in person... we hugged and cried together for a long time,\" she said. Ms Yapar said her parents had made it safely to her brother's house in Mugla, a city in the west of the country. More than 38,000 people have died since the earthquake struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, making it the deadliest in the country's history. Ms Yapar said her parents Firdevs and Yahya lived in their neighbour's car for a day before travelling to the closest city to find shelter and then going to her brother's house. \"I wanted to come and visit them for a few days and gave them a big surprise,\" she said. \"They didn't even know I was coming.\" Ms Yapar, whose childhood friend, aged 34, died in the quake, said: \"I felt so relieved to see them in person. \"They were crying when they saw me at the door. We hugged and cried together for a long time. \"It's really hard to find the exact words to describe how I feel. I was so relieved to see them, but I could see the sadness in their eyes.\" The earthquake, which hit near the town of Gaziantep, was closely followed by numerous aftershocks including one quake that was almost as large as the first. Ms Yapar said her parents would now try to find a permanent place to live. They are \"a bit afraid\" of going back to their hometown of Belen in Hatay, because it is \"almost wrecked\" and \"everyone is leaving,\" she said. \"Most of the hospitals are heavily damaged and some are totally destroyed. My parents are old and have some illness to be treated.\" Ms Yapar said her parents \"are not eager to leave their hometown behind\" but she thinks they will have to. \"They've applied for some rental houses for now and I really need to support them both emotionally and financially.\" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "Syrians in Turkey cross border after earthquake",
      "text": "Hundreds of Syrians living in Turkey have returned to the war-torn country after last week's devastating earthquake. The Turkish government has allowed Syrians with ID cards from the quake-hit Turkish provinces to leave for up to six months. The rule change has led to hundreds queuing for hours at border crossings. Almost four million Syrians have settled in Turkey since civil war broke out in their home country 12 years ago. Some survivors of last week's earthquake are making the trip to the crossings in an attempt to reunite with family members back in Syria, some of whom they have not seen for years. Among them is Reem, who with her nine-month old baby wrapped in a blanket, said she was travelling back to Syria after her home in Turkey was destroyed. She told the BBC she believed hostility towards Syrians in Turkey had grown since the earthquake. \"We tried to find another place to stay but they [the Turkish] kept chasing us away asking us to return to Syria,\" she said. \"We tried staying at mosques but they kicked us out. They also didn't give us any tents. Should I stay in the street with my children? Where should we go?\" Many of those queueing have travelled with their families and large amounts of luggage, waiting for security personnel to allow them forward for processing. Abbas Albakour told the AFP news agency he was returning home to Syria after his home in Kharamanmaras, near the earthquake's epicentre, had been destroyed. \"In Syria, there have been problems for 12 years, but right now the biggest catastrophe is in Turkey,\" he said at the Cilvegozu border crossing. About 1,500 Syrians living in Turkey are thought to have died in the earthquake. Around 3.5 million Syrians in Turkey are registered as refugees, according to the United Nations (UN). Meanwhile, rescue efforts are continuing in Turkey. On Friday, two more people were pulled alive from the rubble in the city of Antakya some 11 days on from the earthquake. One of the survivors, Mustafa Acvi, 34, was found alive after being trapped for 261 hours. While being carried on a stretcher, he was put on a video call with his parents who showed him his new-born baby, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. Nurse Deborah Swan, who was part of the UK's search and rescue response in the Hatay province, told the BBC she treated a man who had been trapped under a collapsed building for three days when a large aftershock occurred. \"It's quite disconcerting being in an unstable, collapsed structure particularly when there's a large aftershock,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme. \"We have to leave the building immediately [when an aftershock occurs] but as soon as we realise the building is okay, we go straight back in.\" The rescued man stands a \"very good chance of surviving\", Ms Swan said. But such rescues are becoming increasingly rare. The death toll in Turkey now stands at more than 38,000, making it the deadliest in the country's history. In Syria, more than 5,800 people have died - the majority in the north-west, an area held by rebel insurgents who are at war with the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict has complicated aid efforts in the country. The UN announced on Friday that more than 140 lorries carrying aid have crossed into north-western Syria from Turkey since the earthquake. Before the earthquake struck, almost all humanitarian aid was delivered through just one crossing - Bab al-Hawa. But earlier this week, Syria agreed to allow the UN to open two further border crossings to help bring in more aid for the earthquake and conflict-hit area. \"We expect to have trucks crossing every single day,\" UN spokesman Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva.",

      "title": "Cyclone Gabrielle: Thousands yet to be contacted after New Zealand storm",
      "text": "New Zealand's prime minister says he expects there to be more deaths from a violent storm which killed eight people and cut off hundreds of communities. More than 4,500 people have yet to be contacted after Cyclone Gabrielle hit on Monday, causing significant flooding and landslides across the North Island. Many cities and towns are also without power or clean drinking water. A national state of emergency has been declared, only the third in New Zealand's history. \"This is undoubtedly the biggest natural disaster that we've seen probably this century,\" Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said. The storm damaged hundreds of mobile phone masts, and Mr Hipkins said many of the thousands of uncontactable people are likely to be found alive and well. But he warned that people need to \"brace themselves\" for more fatalities. Some 10,000 people are also estimated to be displaced. One of the confirmed deaths was a two-year-old girl, whose family watched her being swept away in flood waters. Ella Louise Collins, her husband and their two children were trapped in their one-storey home in Hawke's Bay, one of the hardest hit areas. \"The water was about 10cm (4in) from the ceiling in our house and rose extremely quickly and violently,\" she wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday, quoted by the AFP news agency. They tried to reach a neighbour's roof for safety, but were stopped by what Ms Collins called \"a sudden torrent of water which almost drowned us all\". The water swept away her daughter Ivy, who drowned. In other heart-breaking stories, rugby league star Issac Luke lost his father George, who was killed by a landslide on North Island earlier this week. One woman, Rachel Greene, paid a moving tribute to her mother Marie, whose body was found in the roof cavity of her cottage by her landlord's son after the cyclone. It took Rachel four days to find out what had happened, after multiple phone calls to Marie went to voicemail. \"I want everyone to know what an amazing person she was and how loved she was,\" Rachel told New Zealand news outlet Stuff.co.nz. Cyclone Gabrielle is estimated to have affected at least a third of the New Zealand's population of five million. The storm's damage has been most extensive in coastal communities on the far north and east coast of the North Island - with areas like Hawke's Bay, Coromandel and Northland among the worst hit. The situation in Hawke's Bay, a popular tourist destination with some remote towns, has been of particular concern to authorities. On Friday, some 62,000 homes nationwide were still without power. New Zealand announced a national state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows it to streamline its response to the disaster. The country has only previously declared a national state of emergency on two occasions - during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. New Zealand's climate minister has attributed the scale of the disaster to climate change. Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand's North Island just two weeks after record downpours and flooding in the same region. Four people died in those floods.",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: The warnings at the luxury apartments that turned to dust",
      "text": "Safety concerns at an apartment complex in the Turkish city of Gaziantep were raised long before last week's deadly earthquakes. More than 130 people living there lost their lives. A BBC team has spent three days looking at what happened - and the early warnings voiced by residents. With only a bonfire for light and warmth on a bitter winter's night, an extended family sits at the roadside waiting for a miracle. It's not coming. They've been here for nine days and nights but their loved ones have not been found. This personal grief is being played out in the rubble of one of the most desirable streets money can buy here. \"This is one of the most luxurious residential areas in Gaziantep,\" says musician Yunus Emre, whose cousin and his family of four are missing. \"The wealthiest live here. Those flats are sold for millions.\" But the price of the property meant nothing when the earthquake struck. \"I'm just angry. I want to bring someone to justice but I don't know who,\" says the 28-year-old. For him, so many parties are culpable in what is not just a national tragedy but, with the collapse of so many buildings, a national scandal. \"It starts with the contractor,\" he explains. \"He uses low-quality building material. Next comes the certifying authority. They have the blood of people who died here on their hands. \"It's not right to scapegoat the contractor. The ones who approved this building are responsible together with the government and the state. They shouldn't have signed off on this building project at all.\" The Ayşe Mehmet Polat apartment complex is 24 years old. Four of its six blocks collapsed while other buildings around it stood tall. We came to this site because we had heard that a man said to be the building's contractor had been arrested. He will later tell us through his lawyer he was doing nothing wrong and should bear no responsibility. But what exactly happened here on 6 February, and could it have been prevented? As we return to the complex the next morning, emergency services reveal to us a shocking figure - 136 people are known to have died here as they slept. At a petrol station next door, we ask if they have any CCTV footage of when the earthquakes struck. We are given videos from four separate cameras which show the horror unfolding. First, the violent shaking of the lights, then seconds later, people running for their lives before, finally, a thick cloud of smoke and dust enveloping everything in its path. The neighbouring apartment buildings collapsed in a matter of seconds. As we leave the petrol station, we are drawn to the pile of personal possessions on the edge of the forecourt. It is a deeply upsetting museum of lives suddenly extinguished - homework, dolls, cooking pans and family photos. Scouring the heap, and sobbing inconsolably, is 65-year-old Emel Filik. \"Everything is gone,\" she tells us. She explains that her cousin had been sleeping in one of the four destroyed blocks, and no-one had taken responsibility for keeping the building safe. \"Once you start to live in your flat, nothing happens. No inspection. Earthquake insurance and property insurance don't work either. The municipality doesn't make checks. No such thing as monitoring.\" There had been concerns about these apartments, she says, adding that the head of the residents' association - a woman known as Selma - had even asked neighbours to come to a meeting to listen to her fears. \"Six months ago, Selma told us about the problems of the building. She said 'Dear residents, our buildings might collapse at the slightest of earthquakes. Let's strengthen the pillars. If you're short on money, the municipality could help us for a cheaper solution.' She held several meetings. But nothing happened.\" We find a phone number for Selma and she confirms she held meetings to express her fears. But should residents really have to pay to be safe in their own homes? This was a question of structural integrity, not repainting walls. The head of the organisation representing architects in Turkey, Eyüp Muhçu, tells us the ultimate responsibility for making sure buildings are safe rests with the Turkish government. \"The priority of the central government was not to make the cities safe, but to implement some projects that were solely planned for maximising profits. For this reason, 65% of the current building stock in Turkey is risky. And no measures have been implemented regarding these risky structures.\" With two residents having told us there had been potential problems within the blocks - we start trying to find out if those responsible for the building knew about it and whether they did anything. When we had first arrived at the block the previous night, a boy had come up to us briefly to say his dad had pulled seven people from the rubble with his bare hands. It sounded a remarkable story, given the scale of the destruction we could see, but we didn't discount it. And sure enough, when we hear others talking about the bravery of a man called Bahattin Aşan we decide to track him down. \"I saw the building twirling and crashing down. I came here running, it was dark, raining, there was snow and I was the first responder,\" he tells us. Bahattin Aşan used to work as a security guard at the housing complex. He shows us a harrowing video he took in the smoking ruins, in which he's calling out to those trapped. Some people reply. \"I rescued seven people by myself. It was like the apocalypse. Even now as I'm telling you this, I'm still shaking,\" he says. But what about these supposed concerns over the buildings' safety, I ask? Did he see this? \"In the car park, I witnessed the defects with my own eyes. When I touched the concrete columns it would crumble to dust in my hands, as though it wasn't concrete at all. Iron was rusting in the columns, the rainfall was damaging and corroded the iron.\" When I ask Bahattin Aşan if he ever reported this, he insists it was obvious to the management as well as the residents. \"I used to tell a friend that if they were to give me a flat here I wouldn't take it. I said it was because I didn't think the columns were solid and in an earthquake the building would collapse.\" But the man accused of being the contractor, Mehmet Akay, says the building complied with regulation at the time it was built. He claims that sewage and water works were added to the property after construction - and that this, or other work, may have damaged the supporting columns. How many other security guards and caretakers across Turkey had voiced similar concerns in a country precariously positioned at the crossroads of shifting tectonic plates? The immediate picture that is emerging in this Gaziantep neighbourhood is not of a cover-up or conspiracy - but either indifference or inaction. Everyone knew there was a problem, but nobody did anything. For opposition MP Garo Paylan, from the HDP party, who we meet as he visits this site, it is indicative of criminal negligence on an industrial scale in Turkish construction and oversight. \"This is a crime. This is a sin.\" Mr Paylan accuses the government of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of failing to ensure the safety of new buildings as well as failing to strengthen older ones. \"The scientists were shouting about it, this disaster is coming, but the government did almost nothing. We warned the cities, we warned them to prepare the rescue teams, but they did nothing and we live this catastrophe. They say this is destiny. No, it is not. In civilised countries these kinds of disasters happen but fewer people die. But here we have tens of thousands of people under the rubble.\" Mehmet Akay, the man whom authorities say was the building contractor for the Ayşe Mehmet Polat complex, was arrested on Saturday 11 February - five days after the earthquakes. He was stopped at Istanbul Airport as he tried to leave the country. State prosecutors say he was the building contractor, but responding to questions put to him through his lawyer, Mr Akay claims he was the construction co-ordinator, but not the contractor. He also rejects accusations that cheap building materials were used. In Gaziantep, we ask the local authority, Şehitkamil Municipality, for a response. Spokesman Ahmet Aydın Sert says no complaints were received about the complex buildings, and therefore no inspections were made. \"We went through the records and found no irregularities.\" President Erdogan has conceded that the emergency response to the disaster was slow in places, but has urged his people not to listen to those whom he accuses of politicising a tragedy. His government denies negligence and claims that more than 98% of buildings that collapsed were older - like the Ayşe Mehmet Polat complex - and built before the ruling party took office. There are plenty who would say every country has a moral - if not legal - duty to protect its citizens, no matter the age of their property. And when Turks go to the polls in the summer they will decide for themselves who can best ensure their families are safe in their own homes.

      "title": "Germany: Flights cancelled as strikes wipe out air travel",
      "text": "Seven major German airports have been brought to a standstill after hundreds of ground crew walked out on strike in a row over pay. Aircraft are grounded at Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Bremen, Hamburg, Hanover and Dortmund. More than 2,300 flights have been cancelled affecting 300,000 passengers, with air travel effectively wiped-out. Members of the Ver.di union and Civil Service Association are demanding a 10.5% pay increase for workers. At Leipzig Airport, a handful of international flights got away this morning but domestic flights were cancelled. At Frankfurt Airport, a couple of passengers wheeled suitcases through what is usually the bustling departures terminal. It was, one local TV reporter noted, almost as empty as it had been during the Covid pandemic. The action coincided with the start of the high-profile gathering of world leaders and defence experts at the Munich Security Conference. The arrival of prominent guests was not expected to be affected but other delegates were advised to travel by train. Airports handling emergency aid for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria have said that those cargo flights would continue as scheduled. But the strike - which comes two days after Frankfurt Airport cancelled 200 flights when building work knocked out Lufthansa's online check-in and boarding systems - has prompted a furious response from some German business leaders. Representatives of small and medium business associations condemned the action as unacceptable and accused the unions of taking the whole country hostage for their own interests. And air passengers in Germany are becoming accustomed - even resigned - to this kind of disruption. Last summer, staff shortages led to chaotic scenes at airports as flights were delayed and cancelled and travellers queued for hours at check in and security. A representative for Ver.di said that, unless pay and working conditions improved, those issues would continue and guarantee another turbulent summer at the country's airports. Lufthansa has already announced it will have to reduce its summer programme as a result of staff shortages. Germany's unions are well organised and it's rare to see picket lines because most employees participate in strikes. But workers are expected to hold demonstrations at various airports throughout the day. Their demands have thus far been rejected by employers who are yet to submit their own offer with talks expected to continue next week. And the leader of Ver.di, Frank Werneke, struck a threatening tone earlier. \"The next strikes will have a different dimension,\" he said. \"Unless the employers table a good offer next week, this will be just a taste of what's to come.\"",

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: 'The amount of need here is overwhelming'",
      "text": "An aid worker in Turkey helping earthquake survivors said the amount of support needed made his team \"feel helpless\". Junaid Butt, from Birmingham, arrived at Adana airport on Wednesday with other members of Mercy Relief. They are taking food and blankets to thousands of people left homeless. \"The amount of need here is just immense and overwhelming, especially for a small charity of our size,\" he said. They have helped prepare and distribute more than 1,500 meals a day. \"But it's not enough, it's not even remotely enough,\" Mr Butt said. He said huge amounts of money and manpower are needed. More than 41,000 people are known to have died in Turkey and Syria since two huge earthquakes struck on 6 February. The UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has launched an aid appeal for an estimated 17 million people, many in urgent need of shelter, food and medical support. \"Coming out here and doing what we can, we think it will make us feel somewhat helpful, but we just feel helpless,\" Mr Butt told BBC Radio WM. \"There's so much more that they need and we just can't do it, so we leave here with this empty feeling every single night when we go back.\" The team began work in the Osmaniye region where he said about 30% of buildings had been destroyed or deemed structurally unsafe. He said Turkish authorities had put up camps and shelters in the area. \"There's one makeshift camp that was in a school playground that we visited that houses 120 families. We provided them with hot food,\" he said. They have been working alongside a local organisation to provide aid and in one case sought medical help for a three-year-old boy badly burned. The team later headed to the southern city of Antakaya and found a scene of even worse devastation. \"Around here there's probably 90% destruction or structural damage,\" he said. \"So there's so many more people in so much more need in this area and as we go closer to the epicentre it's getting worse and worse and worse. \"It's mind-blowing, we are walking around and some of the team are saying it just doesn't look real. It looks like it's a film set or something like that. It looks like a war zone.\" The \"situation is causing desperation\" and he said it was quite a tense atmosphere in the city. \"People are getting more and more desperate to find some sort of shelter, somewhere safe for their families,\" he said. The Mercy Relief team has been moving through the streets as quickly as possible. \"We're dropping food packs, we're dropping blankets and we are just moving on from camp to camp to camp.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "The wife of a firefighter who died after tackling a blaze in Edinburgh has paid tribute to him ahead of his funeral. Barry Martin, 38, was critically injured in the fire in the former Jenners department store last month and died in hospital four days later. His wife Shelley described him as a remarkable man who was exhilarated to be a firefighter. His funeral will be held at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh at 12:30. Mrs Martin said their eight-year-old twin sons, Oliver and Daniel, \"could not have wished for a more loving and attentive father\". \"He was a busy dad, transporting our sons to their various activities, and being there for them,\" she added. \"I felt utterly privileged to be his wife throughout our life together and always will.\" Before joining the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Mr Martin was a pest control technician and set up his own company with his wife. She said he was passionate about health and fitness and had a particular interest in the tattoo industry. \"Barry was motivated, proud, and driven to be the best he could be, for himself, for his family, for his colleagues, and for the community and wider public,\" Mrs Martin added. \"Being there for people, during their time of greatest need, meant everything to him in his career. \"Our love, admiration and respect for him, will last forever.\" Mr Martin was based at McDonald Road Community Fire Station in Edinburgh and was part of the Blue Watch. The Blue Watch in all Edinburgh stations will be stood down to allow staff to attend the funeral service. Mr Martin was the first Scottish firefighter to die in the line of duty since Ewan Williamson, who died after being injured in Edinburgh in 2009. Firefighters across the UK held a minute's silence to remember Mr Martin on Monday. In Turkey, firefighters from the UK International Search and Rescue Team helping in the earthquake recovery effort also stopped to pay their respects. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Interim Chief Officer Ross Haggart said: \"Our thoughts remain very firmly with Barry Martin's family as we plan to come together at St Giles' Cathedral to pay our respects. \"Barry was a much-loved husband, father, son and friend to many. \"His Blue Watch colleagues and the wider service will ensure that Barry's selfless duty will never be forgotten.\" Lord Provost Robert Aldridge said Mr Martin's death was a reminder of the \"immense bravery and selflessness of those in our emergency services\". \"The many tributes which have been placed outside Jenners show how deeply Barry's passing has been felt, both by people throughout the city and by his firefighter colleagues in Edinburgh and across the country,\" he added. Mr Martin's funeral cortege will leave McDonald Road Fire Station, travel along Leith Walk and go on to London Road. It will then make its way through Abbeyhill before arriving on the Royal Mile at noon. The service is by invitation only and there will be a private committal afterwards. As a mark of respect, all uniformed emergency services personnel will be able to travel free of charge on Lothian Buses on Friday. Mr Martin was one of more than 100 firefighters involved in tackling the \"serious and complex fire\" at the Jenners building on 23 January. Two other firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation in hospital, and two were treated for burns. A police officer also received treatment. One of the oldest department stores in the world, the Jenners building was undergoing a four-year restoration project. MSPs have called for Mr Martin to be posthumously awarded the George Cross, an accolade which dates back to 1940 and recognises acts of extreme bravery carried out by civilians.",

      "title": "Turkey-Syria earthquakes: Yemeni mother gives birth after being pulled from rubble",
      "text": "A Yemeni mother who fled the war in her home country has given birth to a baby girl ten hours after being rescued from her earthquake-hit home in Turkey. Faten Al Yousifi, who was 39 weeks pregnant, had decorated her baby's nursery and had a birth bag ready to go when the quake struck her flat in Malatya, on 6 February just after 4am. After ten hours of crouching - dazed, dehydrated, and fearing for the safety of her unborn child - she was pulled from the rubble by a family friend, Hisham, and rescue workers. \"I did not believe I was still alive,\" Faten told the BBC via WhatsApp on Thursday. She was rushed to the hospital where the doctors carried out a Caesarean section to deliver her baby girl Loujain, meaning \"silver\" in Arabic. But then, came tragedy. Hisham returned to rescue Faten's husband, and was shocked to see a nearby building had collapsed on top of their flats. Faten's husband, 29-year-old Burhan Al Alimi, had died. His body was recovered three days later. He was in his final year of chemical engineering studies at Inonu University in Malatya. Like any new mother, Faten is sleep deprived and trying to adjust to her newborn's feeding and sleep routines. \"The beginning was very difficult, especially with the circumstances,\" she said. Still, she is grateful. \"I thank everyone who helped me and stood with me,\" she said. \"I had a family when mine wasn't there.\" \"We imagined a beautiful life for our daughter,\" she added. \"But God's will is above everything, everywhere. No one knows where the end will be.\" Since Loujain's arrival, there has been an outpouring of love and support from fellow earthquake survivors in both Yemeni and Turkish communities. Faten has moved in with a friend in Kocaeli, closer to Istanbul. And Yemen's ambassador to Turkey, Muhammad Tariq, has visited the baby. Faten and her husband moved to Turkey after the Iranian-backed Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. Since the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen began in March 2015, the Yemeni community in Turkey has increased to more than 20,000. Yet even before the war, Yemenis were emigrating to Turkey for studies and work following the Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011. Muhammad Amer, president of the Yemeni Students Union in Turkey, said there were now more than 8,000 Yemeni students in the country. So far, he said eight Yemenis had been confirmed dead across Gaziantep, Hatay, Adiyaman, Diyarbakir, Malatya and Iskenderun. Yemeni doctor Mohammed Al-Ara'awi, who arrived Turkey before the war, said he lost his wife, 16-year-old son and young daughter. When the quake hit, he was in Adana city, but his family were in Hatay. After desperately trying to reach neighbours, he travelled to Hatay and was devastated to learn about his family trapped under the rubble. \"Waiting on the rubble was like the Yemeni war that people lived through,\" he said from Istanbul. Idris Aqlan, a 25-year-old student at Gaziantep University, was visiting Istanbul when the earthquake hit. He told the BBC that two Turkish friends died. \"I lived through many difficult situations in Yemen because of the war, but this one was much more difficult,\" he said. The sudden nature of the earthquake did not give people time to prepare, he explained. In war, he said, at least there is time to hide in cellars, in the desert, or in the mountains.

      "title": "Turkey earthquake: Girl survives 10 days under quake rubble",
      "text": "A teenage girl has been rescued 248 hours after last week's devastating earthquake in Turkey. 17-year-old Aleyna Olmez was pulled from the rubble in Kahramanmaraş, a southern city near the epicentre. Her uncle tearfully told rescuers \"we will never forget you\", as he hugged them one by one. Aleyna survived, injured and in freezing weather conditions, for 10 days. But rescues like hers are becoming increasingly rare. More than 41,000 people have died in Tukey and neighbouring Syria from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Neither country has revealed how many people are still missing. Aleyna was gently prised from the ruins of a flattened apartment block, Turkish broadcaster TRT Haber reported. \"She looked to be in good health. She opened and closed her eyes,\" Ali Akdogan, a coal miner who took part in the rescue, told AFP news agency. \"We have been working here in this building for a week now... we are happy whenever we find a living thing - even a cat,\" he added. But the celebrations did not last long. Shortly after the rescue, Turkish soldiers ordered people to leave the scene, because teams were finding corpses that would soon be carried out. In the same city, three women and two children were found alive on Wednesday. Meanwhile the United Nations (UN) launched a \"flash appeal\" on Thursday for $1bn in aid to help the victims in Turkey. The funding will help 5.2 million people over the next three months and allow aid organisations to \"rapidly scale up\" their support, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement. And in Syria, the UN said that more than 100 trucks loaded with aid have crossed into the north-west of the country, since the Syrian government agreed to allow the UN to use two more border crossings. The aid included tents, blankets, heaters, food, medicines and cholera testing kits, the organisation said.",

Her team was made up of firefighters from across the UK, as well as medics, a structural engineer and four search dogs who were deployed to the Hatay province. \"Our main aim was to look for people who were still alive in the rubble and rescue them,\" Ms Atcherley told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast on Thursday. \"The devastation out there... is incredible,\" she said. \"There are entire streets with collapsed buildings, others have fallen on their side.\" The team carries out regular exercises and works together even though it members are from different fire services to ensure they have the bond needed to work effectively. \"I don't think any training can prepare you for the emotional toll and the damage that we've seen,\" she said. \"You do feel the pressure to perform.\" As the first 72 hours in a rescue phase are crucial, the team needed to react quickly, she said. Rescue dogs are trained to sniff out people who are still alive and the team also listens and shouts and asks people to shout back or knock on things. \"Once we've discovered that there is somebody in there then it's all hands on deck to find them,\" Ms Atcherley said. Finding someone was \"incredible\" she said. \"It's a really good feeling.\" \"There were so many people out on the ground... all the locals would come and there would be people everywhere just with anticipation and hope of finding somebody alive.\" Her team rescued eight people and their dogs found three more people who were taken out of the rubble by other teams. \"The people are quite deep in the buildings so it takes quite a long time to do the rescues. You have to figure out where they are and how to safely make a tunnel to them to get them out,\" Ms Atcherley said. The team works in shifts. \"Once we've found someone we will continue work until we get them out. If that takes four hours: great. \"If it takes 20 hours then that's what it takes.\" \"It's a wonderful thing when you see people reunited,\" Ms Atcherley said. \"We feel immensely proud of everything we've done and the lives that we've changed out there.\"",

      "title": "Syria earthquake: Aleppo hospitals overwhelmed by victims",
      "text": "Hospitals in Aleppo do not have enough room for new patients in the wake of last week's devastating earthquake, a doctor in the Syrian city has told the BBC. At the Al-Razi Hospital there are too many beds to fit into the wards. They reach end-to-end through corridors and into the chilly courtyard. \"We weren't able to discharge patients from the hospitals even after treating them. The city is damaged and there are no places for them to go,\" said Dr Nizar Suleiman, the head of orthopaedics. \"Huge numbers of patients came in a short period of time. We have a huge shortage in medicines, so it's really worrying. \"For example, we suffer from a lack of medical equipment to treat fractures. We already suffer from this shortage because of the crisis, and the siege [sanctions] make it worse.\" More than 4,400 deaths and 7,600 injuries have been reported in north-western Syria since a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring southern Turkey on 6 February, according to the UN. The damage to Aleppo is widespread. The BBC was given a rare opportunity by the Syrian government to visit there and speak to medical workers. While walking through the city the BBC team tried to stay quiet, in case we could hear survivors in the broken buildings. Over a week after the earthquake the chance of finding anyone alive in the rubble is slim. But patients keep arriving at Al-Razi Hospital. Abu Muhammad, who spent about 24 hours trapped under the rubble, lies among other survivors on a ward. He lost his wife and three of his five children in the earthquake. He looks at a colourful photo on his phone showing his family in happier times. \"They went to Heaven, they are now with God,\" he says, tearfully. He is thankful for one thing: \"God saved my mobile phone for the sake of remembering them, so at least I can look at their pictures every time I miss them.\" \"I still can't believe what happened to me. Sometimes I feel like it's a nightmare, a bad dream. It can't be reality.\" Tens of thousands of people are now living in churches, mosques or in public spaces and parks after losing their homes. They told us that during the country's civil war, which has been going on for more than a decade, they had almost expected to lose loved ones or property. But the earthquake was so unexpected. It struck while they slept, bringing a fresh wave of suffering that they felt was somehow even harder to bear. The government says its aid effort has been hampered by the economic sanctions that Western powers imposed in response to alleged human rights violations and other abuses committed during the country's 12-year civil war. The US, UK and EU deny this, saying trade in essential goods and humanitarian assistance are exempt from the sanctions. However, even though exports of medical supplies to Syria are not specifically sanctioned, international and regional banks fearful of being punished by Western authorities have in the past been reluctant to approve the financial transactions needed by Syrians to purchase them. On Monday, Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad called for the lifting of all \"unilateral coercive measures\" during a meeting with the UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, Syrian state news agency Sana reported. The government's key allies in the civil war - Russia, Iran and the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah - have committed aid to government-controlled areas of Syria. Aid donated by a number of other countries, including China, Sudan, Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, has also arrived, according to Syrian state media. The BBC saw Russian aid delivered via lorries to a hub at a church in Aleppo. And Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported that a sixth shipment of Iranian aid had arrived. Neighbouring Lebanon meanwhile confirmed that it would open its ports and airports for countries wanting to send aid to Syria. In contrast, opposition-held areas of north-west Syria have only seen a trickle of aid delivered by the UN via Turkey. Mr Mekdad said the Syrian government was committed to \"delivering humanitarian aid to all those in need, in all areas, without any discrimination\". But groups in the opposition enclave are not currently accepting aid from the government, fearing a propaganda victory for Damascus.",

      "title": "Women pulled alive from Turkey quake debris nine days on",
      "text": "Nine days after Turkey's earthquake disaster, three women and two children have been found alive. Forty-two-year-old Melike Imamoglu and 74-year-old Cemile Kekec were pulled from the rubble by rescuers in the Turkish town of Kahramanmaras. Their rescue came as workers turned their attention to cleaning up cities devastated by February's earthquakes. Millions of people across Syria and Turkey are living in makeshift camps and require humanitarian aid. Video of the rescue posted to social media by the Mayor of Darica, Muzaffer Biyik, showed workers applauding and embracing one another as Ms Kekec was loaded into the ambulance. Local media reported that when they found the 42-year-old survivor, Ms Imamoglu, they told her she was \"awesome\". In Antakya- another Turkish city badly affected by the earthquakes - local media reported that a mother and her two children were pulled alive from the rubble. Ten days on from the disaster, it is becoming harder to find quake survivors. The combined death toll has now passed 41,000. Foreign rescue workers who arrived in Turkey shortly after the quakes are beginning to pack up and return home, while locals are shifting their focus to cleaning up the debris. Survivors must now begin to rebuild their lives. The Turkish government has encouraged people to return to their homes if possible, after authorities have declared they are safe. But many have lost their homes and are living in makeshift camps. In Kahramanmaras, where the women were rescued, more than 1,000 survivors camped in a local stadium. In Syria, relief efforts have been hampered by the civil war that has divided the country. The UN did not provide aid to Syria for days, saying logistical issues were to blame. When aid did arrive following the opening of a second border crossing through Turkey, rescuers said they did not supply any of the heavy machinery required to remove rubble. \"It has never happened before, that there was an earthquake somewhere and the international community and the UN don't help,\" said Raed Saleh, who is leading the White Rebels rescue force in opposition-held areas.",
