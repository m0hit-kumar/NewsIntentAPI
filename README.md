 ## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.10.4) used in this project
- pip (package manager for Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-flask-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd NewsIntentAPI
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. With the virtual environment activated, you can now run your Flask app:

   ```bash
   flask run --app index
   ```

   The app should be running locally at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
```

Customize the content as needed for your specific Flask app, and save it as `README.md` in your project's root directory. Be sure to replace `[License Name]` with the actual license name, and consider including a `LICENSE.md` file with license details.
